The header of each commit must not exceed 72 characters in length and must be in 1 line only.

The header and the subject of each commit must be separated by an empty line.

The subject of each commit must not exceed 72 characters in length but can be wrapped to several lines.

The subject and the footer of each commit must be separated by an empty line.

Every pull request must contain at least one commit annotated with the `Changelog-entry` footer. The messages contained in these footers will be used to automatically fill the changelog on every new version.

Also, every update to `meta-balena` should be separated into its own commit, if the body of that commit contains the following line `Updated meta-balena from X to Y` the generated changelog will include a button to show all the updates in `meta-balena` from the version after `X` to `Y`.

An example of a valid commit updating `meta-balena` is:

```
layers/meta-balena: Update to v2.24.0

Update meta-balena from 2.19.0 to 2.24.0

Changelog-entry: Update the meta-balena submodule from v2.19.0 to v2.24.0
```
