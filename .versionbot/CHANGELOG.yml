                        This was mistakenly increased due to confusion between
                        the timeout for

                        requests to the supervisor's api vs the timeout for
                        requests from the

                        supervisor to the balenaCloud api. This separates the
                        two configs and

                        documents the difference between the timeouts whilst
                        also decreasing

                        the timeout for balenaCloud api requests to the

                        be an issue with the delta auth token, which refreshes
                        after

                        DELTA_TOKEN_TIMEOUT (10min), or some other edge case.

                        This prevents an image download error loop where the
                        delta image on the delta server is present,

                        but some aspect of the delta image or the base image on
                        the device does not match up, causing

                        the delta to fail to be applied to the base image.


                        Delta apply errors don't raise status codes as they are
                        thrown from the Engine (although they should),

                        so if an error with a status code is raised during this
                        time, throw an error to the handler

                        indicating that the delta should be retried until
                        success. Errors with status codes raised during

                        this time are largely network related, so falling back
                        to a regular pull won't improve anything.


                        Upon delta apply errors exceeding
                        DELTA_APPLY_RETRY_COUNT, revert to a regular pull.

                The AWS environment is always tied to the balenaCloud deploy
                environment so exposing this to the device workflows is only
                potential for issues, and no benefit.

                For the time being, the deploy environment will contain
                both the AWS and BC vars and secrets.

                This allows more granular control over which environments are
                used

                for which steps, and avoids requiring a single environment to
                define

                how to build, sign, and publish.


                This is better for security as it allows each job to only have

                the secrets it needs, and not all secrets for all steps.


                We retain backwards compatibility by falling back to the
                original

                monolith environment input for now.

                Secure boots builds used to end up with a mismatch between the
                kernel

                and modules signatures because of the use of cache - to avoid
                this we

                temporarily forced builds without cache.


                With the fix in meta-balena
                389054e84c0b1fd382d737c39fb2bb02c2b3e9b2,

                kernel modules are always set not to use cache and this problem
                should

                no longer happen.


                At least during the i.MX secure boot local builds with cache
                never hit

                the problem.


                Remove the setting not to use cache.

                For the first deployment of the S3 download mirror we will
                err on the side of cost savings, and use the mirror as a
                fallback not the primary source of downloads.

                Revert this if we want the benefits of using our own mirrors
                as the primary source, like download speed and no rate limits.

                The /sys/class/gpio interface is bound to be removed anytime so
                let's

                not use it anymore. Instead just make the test set the pin to
                high then

                check its value after reboot then set the pin to low and check
                its value

                again after the next reboot.


                Also, when checking the pin value in /sys/kernel/debug/gpio lets
                search

                When signed images are used without opting in secure boot, we
                don't want

                the encrypted mount service to run and fail as there is no
                encrypted

                boot partition.


                This commit adds a condition to the encrypted boot mount service
                to only

                run if the encrypted boot partition exists, similarly to what is

                already done for EFI builds.

                        This has been broken since splitting the core from the
                        worker - fixing it enables running tests with a local
                        worker without the VPN, much faster and avoids VPN file
                        transfer issues

                We encountered the variance in expected and measured swap in the
                rpi5 to be higher than the allowed value of 10 - to make this
                safe and allowing of more device types, changed the allowed
                variation - still small enough to actually check the value is
                right, but should reduce false negatives

                Tests can get stuck here for 15 to 20 minutes if the timings are
                unlucky. Forcing a supervisor restart ensures a clean slate and
                ensures that the variables are included as quickly as possible

                2.108.6 doesn't exist for generic-amd64. The tests used to still
                work, because we werent acually passing the version to
                kernel-module-build correctly, meaning that it would default to
                the one in the kernel-module-build project. That was fixed in
                4484c59fc924100232cc10303a4636ed0082760a , and now we are
                passing the version correctly, we're looking for a nonexistant
                version. Changing version to match the default.

                A custom template path has originally been added in
                https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/pull/3599
                for the iot-gate-imx8. The iot-gate-imx8plus needs
                one as well because it's now using the meta-balena-hab
                submodule.

                This fixes the following error:

                The signed image symlink is not generated before the flasher needs it so we avoid this dependency issue by
                defining a new image type for which the build system will automatically create the appropriate symlink.

                The altboot test often hangs for a long time during the altboot
                test, after the DUT has booted into the old OS after the altboot
                failure - the check to see if the rollback systemd services have

                ourselves because it's

                easier to have libjim.a compiled here rather than add a whole
                new Yocto recipe just for it.

                At this moment balena-image-flasher depends on
                do_image_sign_digest

                and do_rootfs of balena-image, but this is not enough, as the
                signature

                symlink is only created by a postprocess script.


                This patch replaces the two existing dependencies by
                do_image_complete,

                which should cover everything.

                        This fixes a regression where dependencies would only be started in
                        order and would start the dependent service if its dependency had been
                        started at some point in the past, regardless of the running condition.

                        This makes the behavior more consistent with docker compose where the
                        [dependency needs to be
                        running or healthy](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/69a83d1303a103d82b05d512baf273244b4dbd94/pkg/compose/convergence.go#L441) for the service to be started.

                        This will make the client look for workers with a "DUT:
                        <deviceType>-sb" tag if FLASHER_SECUREBOOT=1 when
                        starting tests. This is to enable differentiation
                        between locked and unlocked DUTs for device types that
                        support secureboot.

                This is specially useful to prevent devices freezing at boot on
                errors,

                for example when the initramfs fail() is called allowing the
                device to

                reboot and rollback.

              hash: 1ae37ac158b93df836126030abec8c3d3f69d92b
              body: >
                At this moment resin-init-flasher just takes whatever image lies
                in /opt

                and dd's it to the target drive. This is fine for general use,
                but with

                secure boot enabled, we want to perform at least basic
                authentication

                of the image being written.


                This patch gets the image signed at build time and makes flasher
                verify

                the signature against a key built-in the kernel trust store. At
                this

                very moment it fails hard if the signature does not match, but
                this may

                change in the future. Technically we only want to know if we are
                about

                to flash a balena-provided image or not, we might want to
                support both

                but behave slightly differently in each scenario.

        The Unipi Raspberry Pi boards we support need the unipi-kernel-modules

        the 2 boards on the 5.15 kernel.


        Also we do not apply 0006-overlays-Add-Hyperpixel4-overlays.patch and
        0001-Add-tpm-slb9670-tis-spi-DT-overlay.patch

        for the 5.15 anymore since the requests for them were not for the Unipi

                This change makes the legacy NFS cache mount
                optional, and will not fail the build if unset
                or unreachable.

                Instead, if the NFS is available it will be used
                as a read-only mirror for shared downloads,
                but will not be updated with new files.

                      hash: 828bd22ba053aa08ca2bde8e72b3aa7ed82aae02
                      body: >
                        This config backend uses ConfigJsonConfigBackend to
                        update

                        os.power and os.fan subfields under the "os" key, in
                        order

                        to set power and fan configs. The expected format for
                        os.power

                        and os.fan settings is:

                        ```

                        {
                          os: {
                            power: {
                              mode: string
                            },
                            fan: {
                              profile: string
                            }
                          }
                        }

                        ```


                        There may be other keys in os which are not managed by
                        the Supervisor,

                        so PowerFanConfig backend doesn't read or write to them.
                        Extra keys in os.power

                        and os.fan are ignored when getting boot config and
                        removed when setting

                        boot config.


                        After this backend writes to config.json, host services
                        os-power-mode

                        and os-fan-profile pick up the changes, on reboot in the
                        former's case

                        and at runtime in the latter's case. The changes are
                        applied by the host

                        services, which the Supervisor does not manage aside
                        from streaming

                        their service logs to the dashboard.

                        Add `os-power-mode.service`, `nvpmodel.service`, and
                        `os-fan-profile.service`

                        which report status from applying power mode and fan
                        profile configs as read

                        from config.json. The Supervisor sets these configs in
                        config.json for these

                        host services to pick up and apply.


                        Also add host log streaming from
                        `jetson-qspi-manager.service` as it

                        will very soon be needed for Jetson Orins.

                        didn't get to

                When `os_bc_skip` is set, the bootcount variable is not set and
                the

                altboot check incorrectly assumes the boot limit has exceeded.


                Make sure the bootcount comparison only takes place if bootcount
                has

                been set.

                Right now if the flashing script errors out the initramfs just
                keeps

                running modules. This is a security risk specially for secure
                boot

                systems as at that point we have an authorized trusted OS
                running in

                an unvetted path.


                This commit exits init if the flasher returns, and also attemps
                to crash

                the kernel followed by an infinite sleep for paranoic reasons.

                        specified.

                        installed at <v14.1.0,

                        in which a Supervisor app with random UUID is kept in
                        the target db due to its appId

                        being the same, even after the BM instance has upgraded
                        to v14.1.0 which patches

                        the correct reserved Supervisor app UUIDs in. This
                        results in two Supervisors running

                        on devices under the BM instance which persists after BM
                        upgrade.

                        On NXP iMX devices the partitions are not encrypted with
                        LUKS but with

                        the lower level dm-crypt subsystem.


                        Adapt the partition mount script to use dmsetup which
                        works for both

                        LUKS and dm-crypt encrypted partitions.

                        Debian no longer publishes linux/arm/v5 images for
                        bullseye, breaking

                        support for raspberry pi zero.


                        This change might not solve the issue indefinitely

                        as we don't know how long debian will continue
                        publishing armv5 images.

                        This moves from throwing an error when an app is
                        rejected due to unmet

                        requirements (because of contracts) to storing the
                        target with a

                        `rejected` flag on the database.


                        The application manager filters rejected apps when
                        calculating steps to

                        prevent them from affecting the current state. The state
                        engine uses the

                        rejection info to generate the state report.

                The existing method of using labels allows for
                Actions Time Of Check to Time Of Use (TOCTOU) attacks
                because we do not associate the label with any commit.

                This action requires approvals via reactions on a unique
                comment generated for each workflow run.

                Some device types (generic-armd64) need to run the test

                suites twice for the same base image, once with secure boot

                vars enabled in Leviathan, and once without.


                Rather than run the suites in series, or require building the

                image twice, we can allow the test matrix to define separate
                runs

                for the two modes.

                When evaluating expressions for cancel-in-progress, certain
                parameters may not be available at the time of evaluation.

                For instance, the github.job context is not accessible, as it's
                specific to the running job and not the concurrency group.

                A previous commit added quotes to some of the `balena deploy`
                command args - when $status or $_debug aren't defined, this
                means empty quote gets passed as an arg, making the CLI fail.

                We currently have many `8cpu` runners available that are

                migrating from Jenkins that we should allow to use for yocto
                builds.


                As long as some runners don't have the `yocto` tag so we don't
                bottleneck the runner queue for other orgs.

                The "All jobs" job is used for branch protection
                as it captures the overall success/fail of all
                the test matrices and build.

                However without a unique name we are unable
                to identify the device type in order to mark it as required.

                This change adds a single instance matrix
                to the build job and as a result will append the machine
                name and deploy environment in the job name.

                Secure boot enabled partitions need to split the boot partition
                into

                an encrypted and a non-encrypted one.


                Unless the device type natively separates the files that the
                bootROM

                needs to boot, like EFI does into /mnt/boot/EFI, a list of files
                to

                move to the non-encrypted partition needs to be provided on the

                BALENA_NONENCRYPTED_BOOT_PARTITION_FILES variable, and a
                function

                to implement the split needs to be provided.


                This commit introduces a split_bootpartition() function that
                performs

                this and can be used for those platforms that need to list the
                boot

                essential files in a BALENA_NONENCRYPTED_BOOT_PARTITION_FILES
                variable.


                This is typically called from the bootpart_split() function in
                the

                balena-init-flasher customization file.

              hash: d1deb3e4fc8744fe66e1b5a726c82b4a856f2fe4
              body: >
                On secure boot enabled devices the boot partition is split into
                an

                encrypted boot partition (/mnt/boot) and a non-encrypted boot
                partition

                (/mnt/<name>).


                On the built rootfs all files live in `/mnt/boot`, and the
                installation

                needs to create an encrypted /mnt/<name> and move some files
                from

                /mnt/boot there.


                UEFI platforms make this easy as the non-encrypted files are
                stored on a

                different /mnt/boot/EFI folder. However, other platforms need to
                list

                which files to move by name.


                This commit introduces a skip_nonencrypted_boot_files() helper
                function

                for these other platforms to use.


                It is typically called from a do_skip() function in the
                os-helpers-sb

                secure boot customization file.

                This service needs to be restarted every time the
                fan profile is modified in config.json, so that
                it can apply the change and restart the device
                specific fan control daemon. This is unlike the
                power model service, which only runs once, at startup.

              body: |
                At this moment the abroot script assumes that the boot partition
                is already in place when it executes. This might not be true
                if the rootfs sits on a device that takes a while to initialize,
                such as a USB drive. The script fails hard if that is the case.

                This patch replicates a waiting loop from the rootfs script,
                which addresses the same issue for systems that do not use
                the balena bootloader.

                The TPM is capable of storing a limited number of auth session
                handles.

                Ensure auth sessions are flushed after use, to prevent

                tpm2_startauthsession from failing with 'out of session
                handles'.

                With the update to MM 1.22.0 we have received reports that
                SIM7100E is not functioning correctly.
                Followed up with ModemManager devs and it was discovered the issue
                is related to a PCO setting:

                hook"
              hash: c9544aaf502943f3b492d0a5907f1c1e401c6ac7
              body: >
                cut is sensitive to the amount of delimiter characters when
                parsing

                output, so e.g. an additional space between two elements causes

                every field shift by one index.


                This patch replaces the use of cut by awk, which should be more
                robust.

                it

                * Checks that the boot partition is split

                * Checks that it can find the correct amount of encrypted
                partitions

                * Checks that the label on the unlocked filesystem matches the
                label
                  on the encrypted partition
                * Checks that system is not mixing encrypted and unencrypted
                  partitions
                * Checks there are no ambiguities or duplicit partitions

                When this config.json field has a value, the supervisor will
                treat the device as managed and will crash and start to boot
                loop.


                On faster device-types we don't seem to notice and the tests
                pass by chance, but on Pi Zero and similar we consistently see
                ECONNRESET when hitting local SV endpoints.

                        Users may specify dnsu2t config by including a `dns`
                        field

                        in the `proxy` section of PATCH /v1/device/host-config's
                        body:

                          network: {
                            proxy: {

                        ```


                        If `dns` is a string, ADDRESS and PORT are required and
                        should be

                        in the format `ADDRESS:PORT`. The endpoint with error

                        `dns` may also be a boolean. If true, defaults will be
                        configured.

                        If false, the dns configuration will be removed.


                        If `proxy` is patched to empty, `dns` will be removed
                        regardless

                        of its current or input configs, as `dns` depends on an
                        active

                        The following pattern

                        ```ts

                        async function longRunning() {
                           // do something
                           await setTimeout(delay);
                           await longRunning();
                        }

                        ```


                        Is regularly used for long running operations on the
                        supervisor (e.g.

                        polling target state). We have

                        recently discovered that this pattern can slowly leak
                        memory as it

                        essentially creates an infinite promise chain. Using
                        `void longRunning()` breaks

                        the chain and avoids the issue.


                        This commit fixes all those instances where the pattern
                        was used.

                        This adds some

                        backpressure on `log` calls by by the log monitor
                        module, to prevent a

                        very agressive container causing the supervisor to waste
                        CPU cycles just

                        dropping messages.

                        This removes the dependence of the supervisor on the
                        containerLogs

                        database for remembering the last sent timestamp. This
                        commit instead

                        uses the supervisor startup time as the initial time for
                        log retrieval.

                        This might result in some logs missing for services that
                        may start

                        before the supervisor after a boot, or if the supervisor
                        restarts.

                        However this seems like an acceptable trade-off as the
                        current

                        implementation seems to make things worst in resource
                        contrained

                        environments.


                        We'll move storing the last sent timestamp to a better
                        storage medium in

                        a future commit.

                when building + deploying or a private DT , the check to see if the DT is private fails. This is due to https://github.com/balena-os/balena-yocto-scripts/blob/master/automation/include/balena-api.inc#L424 using this function: https://github.com/balena-os/balena-yocto-scripts/blob/master/automation/include/balena-lib.inc#L191 - which uses the jenkins deployTo variable to select the correct api url and token.

                Previously an empty test matrix would cause
                an error in the workflow.

                Added an if condition to check for a valid
                test_suite property where applicable.

                checks, we have to fetch the workflow runs for the appropriate
                commit to determine a test pass/fail.

                As there are currently more device types without tests than
                with,

                and some of those with tests need to provide overrides anyway,
                it's

                simpler to assume an empty test matrix unless provided.

                        the function that was being used to fetch the DUT ip
                        from the worker had nested retries that led to 30x5 =
                        150 retries, and timeouts taking ~40 mins in the case
                        the DUT wasn't reachable (autokit setup fault, device
                        not booting, problem during flashing). This removes the
                        nested retries and reduces the retries to 50 /  ~ 10mins

                With the update to ModemManager version 1.22.0 we now have some

                to use QMI properly:


                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] power state updated: on

                .

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] failed waiting for final state: Too
                much time waiting to get to a final state

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem0] failed enabling modem: Operation

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem1] couldn't start initialization:

                ModemManager[1178]: [modem1] fatal error initializing: Fatal
                error: modem is unusable


                This has been fixed upstream with the 2 patches we backport
                here:


                ModemManager[1139]: [modem0] power state updated: on

                        allow tests to

                        pass.

                        immediately"
                      hash: 41b535e9ad160a6c663cf39137da562b4843829a

                        There is a problem where if the multiple jobs are
                        running at the same time, all waiting for a worker to be
                        IDLE, multiple jobs start using the worker at the same
                        time. The reason was that first, the state of the worker
                        is polled using /state - then, after some delay, it is
                        reserved using the /start endpoint. Problem 1 was that
                        there is a delay between checking and reserving -
                        leading to a window of time where another job could do
                        the same thing. Problem 2 is that once /start was used,
                        there was nothing to stop the client from continuing,
                        even if the worker was BUSY. This commit forgoes the
                        /state endpoint, and just skips to trying /start - if
                        the worker is IDLE, its instanly reserved, if its BUSY,
                        the reponse is actually checked and nothing happens.

                Sometimes on NetworkManager restart a new rule for a shared

                is added, but the old rule is not cleaned up properly, so the
                rules

                are just piling up. This patch makes the shared dispatcher
                script

                clean up duplicates if it finds any.

        Add RevPi specific udev rules and helper script for mac address

        configuration from HAT eeprom. The ruleset will ensure that the
        following

        things behave similar to a stock RevPi OS:


        - Alias for RS485 interfaces (eg. /dev/ttyRS485)

        - Set mac address from HAT EEPROM for interfaces without own eeprom

        - Set interfaces names according to device markings

        - Use correct interface names for PiBridge ethernet interfaces (without
        this
          gateways can't work with piControl)

      body: |
        The latest layers updates have reached the maximum size. This increase
        should not affect existing devices as long as the new kernel plus
        initramfs bundle still fits in the existing partitions.

    - subject: use dwc2 driver for USB host mode in CM4-SB.
      hash: fdb332ba7f2d5faf79f2a5cc831cffdadae83400
      body: |
        The `otg_mode=1` setting makes the firmware mux the USB port
        to the XHCI host-only controller. However, even though this correctly
        enabled host mode in the USB port, the kernel drivers oops when a cable
        is plugged into the OTG port in the ioboard, probably because the XCHI
        controller does not support OTG or device mode.

        This commit reverts to using the dwc2 kernel overlay which has less
        performance but does not crash.

      hash: 6838519e97b7526e580b6a4e4491cbdec3ac0f7f
      body: |
        As CM4 and CM4IO don’t include the external USB 3 controller,
        RaspberryPi OS sets `otg_mode=1` for better performance.

        See https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/config_txt.html#otg_mode-raspberry-pi-4-only

        However, while testing, the kernel driver oops when the otg cable is
        connected at boot (works well if it is connected after boot though).

        As this is only needed in the USB provisioning mode, restrict the change
        to the raspberrypicm4-ioboard-sb for the time being.

        This is useful for the use case of a flasher image ran from external
        media, like in the traditional flasher workflow that expects the device
        to shutdown after programming.

    - subject: Modify boot order to prioritize USB boot
      hash: dad87cfcd68052e35adb5efcf916e6d3726540ed
      body: |
        With this change the device will first attempt to boot from USB and then
        boot from the NVME/internal eMMC/SD card. This allows to use USB flasher
        images as provisioning tools in preference of usbboot.

        5: USB 2.0 boot from USB type A socket (CM4) or Type C socket (RPI4)
        6: NVME
        1: eMMC / SD Card
        2: Network boot

        We place NVME before eMMC/SDcard as there are reports that NVME is not
        working if initialized after.

        Also, there is no USB mass storage boot to limit this option to using
        physical jumper configuration.

        See https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#BOOT_ORDER

        Note that trying USB boot first adds a considerable delay to the boot
        process as the CM4 has a timeout of 2s (5s if extended via
        `program_usb_boot_timeout=1`  per USB port enumeration.

        As such, this change is only done to the `raspberrypicm4-ioboard-sb`
        that requires USB boot for the secure boot provisioning flow.

                Use the flasher configuration file to specify the post-install

                This is to shutdown (the default) when the flasher runs from an
                external

                media, or to reboot when running from the same media as is the
                case for

                the migrator tool.


                Also, assert that a locked device can only install from memory.

                Traditionally after programming the flasher image would shutdown
                the

                device to allow for the removal of the external device and
                booting from

                the internal storage.


                As more use case appeared, like programming from the initramfs
                when the

                flasher image runs on the same target device it will program,
                the post

                install action needs to support rebooting instead as physical
                access to

                the device to power on cannot be expected. This is the case for
                remote

                migration, AMI VM installs and also secure boot installs.


                The current code just checks for the existence of the `shutdown`
                command

                which is not present on the initramfs to decide whether to
                shutdown or

                reboot.


                This commit improves that logic by defaulting to shutdown but
                allowing the

                configuration file to specify a reboot instead.


                Also, it improves the robustness of the reboot/shutdown by
                falling down

                to sys-rq, and provides a way to override the reboot/shutdown by
                device

                layers that require it.

                        The host-config module exposes the following interfaces:
                        get,

                        patch, and parse.


                        `get` gets host configuration such as redsocks proxy
                        configuration

                        and hostname and returns it in an object of type
                        HostConfiguration.


                        `patch` takes an object of type HostConfiguration or
                        LegacyHostConfiguration

                        and updates the hostname and redsocks proxy
                        configuration, optionally

                        forcing the patch through update locks.


                        `parse` takes a user input of unknown type and parses it
                        into type

                        HostConfiguration or LegacyHostConfiguration for
                        patching, erroring if

                        parse was unsuccessful.


                        LegacyHostConfiguration is a looser typing of the user
                        input which does

                        not validate values of the five known proxy fields of
                        type, ip, port,

                        username, and password. We should stop supporting it in
                        the next

                        major Supervisor API release.

                        input is of an acceptable shape (for backwards
                        compatibility).


                        Once input has been determined to be of type
                        HostConfiguration,

                        we can easily extract ProxyConfig from the object for

                        stringifying, and writing to redsocks.conf.

                        This fixes a regression on the supervisor state engine
                        computation

                        (added on v16.2.0) when

                        the target state removes a network at the same time that
                        a service

                        referencing that network is changed. Example going from


                        ```

                        services:
                           one:
                              image: alpine: 3.18
                              networks: ['balena']

                        networks:
                           balena:
                        ```


                        to


                        ```

                        services:
                           one:
                              image: alpine: latest
                        ```


                        Would never reach the target state as killing the
                        service in order to

                        remove the network is prioritized, but one of the
                        invariants in the target state calculation is

                        to not kill any services until all images have been
                        downloaded. These

                        two instructions were in contradiction leading to a
                        deadlock.


                        The fix involves only adding removal steps for services
                        depending on a

                        changing network or volume if the service container is
                        not being removed

              hash: 0b6199dddbb52e963d7b6e5feb5771f2b61a0f35
              body: >
                At this moment the kexec initrd script is skipped when
                ROOTFS_DIR

                is not defined or if the new rootfs is mounted, but does not
                contain

                a kernel image in the expected place. This is undesirable as we

                assume this is the last script executed by the balena
                bootloader.


                This patch makes the kexec script always execute in the balena

                bootloader and makes it fail hard in unexpected states, which
                means

                the script is always an exit point for the balena bootloader,

                whether the actual kexec call succeeds or not.

    - subject: adjust reboot watchdog timeout
      hash: dc157ca57779d79b3afcf886bb093703a4adaa37
      body: >
        By default, the second stage watchdog time that is used to set the

        watchdog once systemd-shutdown has stopped all services and replaced

        PID1 with itself is set to 10m.


        However, the RPI watchdog has a maximum timeout of 15s, so we adjust
        this

        value accordingly.


        This helps ensure that when a shutdown or reboot is triggered, the
        device

        can fallback to a watchdog reboot if it gets stuck.

                mixed a test for string length with a test for string equality.

                The include syntax allows full control over settings used

                in each test job, but the combinatorial is simpler to write

                for basic use cases.


                Rather than force one, we can allow both and default to the
                simple

                syntax.


                Marking as minor since the input syntax has changed, but isn't

                currently used in production anywhere.

                We do not need to run the workflow on close/merge, and we
                can skip the manual workflow runs on this project as
                each device type will have it's own workflow in the device
                repos supporting manual triggers.

                This is a helper job to avoid having to mark all build/test
                matrices as required, as this job will always run and return
                success or failure.

              body: >
                At this moment the kexec initrd script just takes the original
                kernel

                command line, replaces root with UUID and removes bootloader
                args.


                We have found at least one use-case (on the Pi4 and firmware
                GPIOs),

                where a different initrd script needs to pass extra arguments

                to the kexec'd kernel. With this patch it will append the
                contents

                of the KEXEC_EXTRA_ARGS variable to the kernel command line.

                In 328222014146f0116e0208443f3e255d0e85ef15 we have removed

                the signed-update hook from systems that do not have EFI

                in MACHINE_FEATURES. This on its own makes sense, however
                together

                with it we have also removed the runtime check for whether the
                running

                system is actually booted in UEFI mode.


                This effectively means it is no longer possible to update the
                host OS

                on a device type able to boot in both UEFI and BIOS modes

                (intel-nuc and genericx86-64-ext) when booted in BIOS mode,

                as the signed-update hook is executed unconditionally and fails

                if the device is not running UEFI.


                This patch re-adds the runtime check to only execute the hook

                if the system is actually booted in UEFI mode.

                On parallel builds that share a state cache there are mismatches

                signed

                        This goes in the direction of grouping modules by

                We have detected one more way in which the uuid file used by
                containerd

                can get corrupted. This time, the file is not empty, but doesn't
                contain

                a valid UUID either.


                This commit thus extends the existing workaround to also handle
                this

                case.

                in an improper calculation of the PCR 7 digest, and an
                unbootable

                system.


                Read the file contents, skipping the first four bytes that are

                attributes, and pipe the data directly to tcgtool to work around
                this.

                Some hooks, such as 0-signed-update, will attempt to read files
                from the

                EFI system partition, such as combined policy binaries.


                Bind mount the EFI partition into old_rootfs before running
                hooks to

                ensure this is available.

                When rollback-health runs, a failing healthcheck causes the

                hostapp-update hooks to be run from the inactive partition, to
                make the

                inactive system bootable again.


                The 0-signed-update hook, which updates the sealing policy for
                secure

                boot enabled systems, reads from the securityfs mounted at

                /sys/kernel/security in order to parse the TPM event log.


                If this filesystem isn't mounted, the hook will improperly
                detect that

                the TPM event log isn't available, and unneccessarily create a
                combined

                policy when a single PCR policy would suffice.


                Mount this filesystem in old_rootfs before chrooting to fix
                this.

                In commit 1c19ebb, we append digests from the TPM event log

                corresponding to events that are logged before EV_SEPARATOR. For

                instance, parsing the event log on a typical system for event
                types, the

                output looks like this:


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_SEPARATOR


                This system requires no merging of event log digests.


                On systems that measure EFI binaries (mostly only QEMU w/ edk2),
                we also

                get this:


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_SEPARATOR

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY (bootx64.efi)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY (bzImage)


                Again, this requires no merging. We compute the signature of the

                relevant EFI binaries ourselves, as they're subject to change
                during

                hostapp-update.


                However, we've also seen event logs like this:


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_EFI_ACTION (DMA Protection Disabled)

                EV_SEPARATOR


                This case is the one we've handled previously, by reading from
                the event

                log and appending event digests before EV_SEPARATOR. We stopped
                at

                EV_SEPARATOR because we weren't parsing event types previously,
                and this

                digest is a constant that's easily recognized. However, we've
                since

                encountered systems that have unexpected events *after*
                EV_SEPARATOR, as

                shown below.


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_SEPARATOR

                Unknown event type (?!)


                In order to handle this, parse digests and event types into
                temporary

                files and iterate through them together. We only stop appending
                digests

                from the event log when the next event type is
                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY

                (EFI binary signature) or we hit the end of the list. This
                should

                account for all possible variations.

                Manipulating the firewall rules by index introduces a race
                condition.

                Both NetworkManager and balenaEngine add the rules to the top

                of the FORWARD chain instead of appending, so if we first look
                up

                a rule by number and then use the number to refer to it, we can
                not

                guarantee that the rule number has not changed (iow the rule has
                not

                been moved down) in the meantime.


                This patch removes the use of rule numbers completely and makes

                the "shared" dispatcher script refer to the rules by definition.

    - subject: Fix missing wifi and BT when balena bootloader is used
      hash: 7e4cfb998d66ccfce97d99ed355b065026918296
      body: |
        The Pi4 devices (Pi4, CM4, Pi400) use an internal 8-pin GPIO header
        to control some firmware features including wifi and bluetooth.
        Initially these are set up by the broadcom bootloader, but after kexec
        (which the balena bootloader uses), they are all reset to zeroes.
        This means wifi and bluetooth "disappear" after kexec.

        This patch adds an initrd scripts that reads the GPIO pin values before
        kexec and appends them as an extra kernel argument. After kexec,
        it reads the kernel argument and restores the pin values to what they
        originally were.

    - subject: Fix race condition between signing and generating boot partition
      hash: 6a5a8eca98bbead52004f54811b1d2a91f22d9a4
      body: |
        At this moment do_balena_signed_bootgen_and_deploy
        and do_image_balenaos_img tasks run in parallel, which is causing
        problems as do_image_balenaos_img needs to use the output
        of do_balena_signed_bootgen_and_deploy to generate the contents
        of the boot partition. Since the call to the signing server takes
        several seconds, sometimes `boot.sig` or `boot.img` or both
        are not included in the final image, depending on when
        do_image_balenaos_img is actually executed.

        This patch reorders the tasks so that do_image_balenaos_img is only
        started after do_balena_signed_bootgen_and_deploy.

    - subject: increase the boot partition size for CM4 to support secure boot
      hash: 5ec24a2f313afa562533375a73217c5d70cef00e
      body: |
        When performing a hostOS update we perform atomic writes of individual
        files, that is, first we copy a new file, and then we rename.

        The rename operation is atomic on some filesystems like ext4, but on
        vfat it has not been atomic until Linux kernel v6.0.

        Hence, balenaOS uses a `fatrw` library that keeps a checksummed copy of
        the file until the rename completes and can be verified. Unfortunately,
        for hostOS updates `fatrw` will fallback to a non-atomic rename if there
        is not enough space to keep a checksummed copy of the file. This will
        stop being a problem once a >6.0 kernel is used.

        Now, a secure boot enabled CM4/RPI4 required a single boot.img that
        contains all the essential boot firmware. This contains the balena
        bootloader and its initramfs that needs packages to mount encrypted
        file systems. Basically, the size of the balena booloader increases to
        around 50M, and the size of boot.img to around 60M, so we need at least
        double that in order to perform atomic updates of this file.

                        type. Whereas in io-ts@2.2.21, t.record will strip the
                        invalid key and

                        decode to Right. This is a breaking change for us.

                        The `mdns-resolver` module does not provide a default
                        export. Trying to

                        use a default import notation, causes the `resolve`
                        function to not be

                        found, breaking MDNS resolution.

                        Since HTTP's server.close() is async, there is a slim
                        chance

                        for two instances of /v1/reboot or /v1/shutdown to be
                        processed.

                        If the server is already closed when server.close() is
                        called,

                        the call throws ERR_SERVER_NOT_RUNNING

                        which doesn't need to be surfaced to the user. This
                        change

                        only allows one server.close() attempt to occur at a
                        time.

                        The Supervisor should only care whether a lockfile
                        exists or

                        not. This also fixes an edge case where a user symlinked
                        a lockfile

                        to a nonexistent file, causing the Supervisor to enter
                        an error

                        loop as it was not able to `stat` the nonexistent file.

                        io-ts types that were generated using
                        `shortStringWithRegex` were testing

                        against `VAR_NAME_REGEX`, instead of the Regex that was
                        specified when

                        generating the type. This affected `DockerName` such
                        that service names with

                        a dash in the middle were returning as false when passed
                        through the

                        `DockerName.is` type guard, affecting how
                        `getServicesLockedByAppId` was

                        returning a map of locked services.

                The migrate module is currently only enabled if specified in
                config.json.

                This commit introduces a command line argument override for
                board

                integration layers to use. This allows for example for
                non-flasher device

                types to force the migration.

                As soon as the UUID is regenerated udev runs the correspondign
                rules.


                However, the rules expect the new UUID to be cached in a file,
                so there

                is a race condition between the creation of the file and the
                udev rule.


                This commit avoid the race condition by using a file mutex that
                the

                udev rule can wait on.

                As soon as the UUID is modified udev re-runs the rules for the
                partition.

                However, the rule expects the new root UUID to be cached in a
                file, and

                if the udev rule gets there before the file is created it fails.

                Remounting filesystems is done on systems with a broken clock in
                order

                to prevent tune2fs from bailing out when the last mounted time
                is in the

                future. This resets the last mounted time to now.


                However, the filesystem is immediately unmounted again without
                being

                utilized, and the mount and unmount process is time consuming.
                Instead,

                use `-e continue` to tell tune2fs to continue after an error,
                which

                achieves the same result with less time and complexity.

                When a ESR release is deployed a tag with the base meta-balena
                version

                is created. This is used by the API to check for a valid OS
                version

                for updates.


                The current mechanism to find the base version only provides an
                ESR

                version for the first commit after the branch has been created.


                Using merge-base to find the common ancestor and `tag
                --points-at` to

                find the actual tag works for all commits after the branch is
                created.

                This behaviour was fine until a recent CI issue changed the

                This commit allows supporting of both types while the CI issue

                For some device types it's been noted that it takes longer than
                the time it takes do do one check of the iptables rules for the
                intended rules to appear, leading to a failure. This aims to
                make the check more consistent by checking 5 times before
                failing.

                The firmware_measures_efibins function outputs different strings

                depending on whether the TPM event log is available, and whether
                or not

                EFI binaries are measured into PCR 7 as indicated in the event
                log.


                We don't need to print the output of the parsed event log, so
                redirect

                it.

                A missing semi-colon caused the firmware_measures_efibins

                unavailable and it's impossible to tell."


                Taking the wrong branch in this conditional led to an
                inappropriate

                policy being created to seal the LUKS passphrase, which could

                This change is required to migrate existing tests to run QEMU

                GitHub hosted runners can't run the `ping` command:

                If we still intend to use `ping`, the solution would be running
                QEMU worker tests on self-hosted runners which allow ICMP

                The takeover project currently relies on the ldd script being
                present in the hostOS pre-migration.


                While takeover can be adapted to use this script from a
                different location, it wouldn't hurt to have ldd in the hostOS
                from this point on.

                        attempts will fail rather than only the ones for

                        With Alpine 3.19, iptables gets bumped to 1.8.10 which
                        uses nftables.

                        The host OS still uses iptables 1.8.7 (legacy), and we
                        should

                        use legacy as well until the OS uses nftables.

                The main variables measured into PCR7 to ensure secure boot
                configuration integrity are the state and EFI vars, including PK, KEK,
                db, dbx, etc.

                However, some systems have firmware that will measure other, unexpected
                events, such as "DMA Protection Disabled" (related to a Windows feature
                [0]), or "Unknown event type" with strange data.

                These events can't be predicted, and other devices may have different
                measured events that aren't compliant with the TCG spec, so attempt to
                check the TPM event log and extend our digest with any unknown events
                that fit the bill.

              hash: 80f9bd84de394aa728ed802a2d4c02f3a87f370b
              body: >
                When migrating the TPM2 policy used to secure the LUKS
                passphrase to use

                different PCRs, we temporarily want to maintain fallback
                capability in

                case the newly installed hostapp doesn't pass healthchecks. This
                allows

                the system to boot back into the original OS and try again.


                In order to do so, we leave the passphrase in place with the old
                PCR

                authentication policy. The cryptsetup hook in the initramfs will
                try

                PCRs 0,2,3,7 and if those don't work we fallback to the original
                PCRs.


                Once the new system successfully boots, we'll re-encrypt the
                passphrase

                and use the new PCRs to create a policy to secure the key.

              body: >
                When encrypting the LUKS passphrase, we need the ability to
                construct a

                policy that can logically OR together multiple policies, such as
                when

                the machine may or may not measure binaries loaded through EFI
                boot

                services into PCR7.


                We also need the ability to update the sealing policy to revoke

                previously valid configurations, such as after
                hostapp-healthcheck

                completes successfully. Ideally, this should be completed before

                modifying any efi variables, to prevent the system from becoming

                unbootable in the event of an interrupted update.


                These requirements necessitate the ability to create sealing
                policies

                and authenticate against them outside of the
                hw_{en,de}crypt_passphrase

                functions.


                This commit allows the caller to setup the sealing policy when

                encrypting, and choose what kind of authentication to use when

                decrypting.

                normally

                computed by the firmware before the OS boots. This allows for
                adjusting

                a TPM2 policy to unlock the disk encryption passphrase with the
                updated

                state on the next boot.

                The dispatcher script that moves around FORWARD rules of shared

                interfaces currently calls iptables assuming it will always work

                but in practice two iptables commands can not run in parallel

                and we have occasionally seen the script fail with:


                Another app is currently holding the xtables lock.

                Perhaps you want to use the -w option?


                This patch adds the -w option to make the script wait for the
                lock

                when necessary.


                It also makes the script exit with an error code if anything
                fails,

                which will log the output as WARN instead of INFO as the errors

                are easy to overlook at this moment.

      body: |
        The PWRSEQ_SD8787 driver did not comply with the dependencies to be
        built-in, so change to module which is its actual setting avoiding
        the kernel check warning.

                We don't need any iptables features in order to perform

                hostapp-update in this build recipe, and it has no impact

                on build output.


                It does, however, improve compatbility with build environments
                and

                reduces the dependencies of the build host kernel.

                        Node 20 now implements the happy eyeballs algorithm as part of its core
                        `net` module, with the [autoSelectFamily](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/net.html#netgetdefaultautoselectfamily) option of `socket.connect`. This option defaults to `true`, meaning that a separate
                        implementation of happy eyeballs is no longer needed.

                        This updates balena lint to the latest version to enable
                        eslint support

                        and unblock Typescript updates. This is a huge number of
                        changes as the

                        linting rules are much more strict now, requiring
                        modifiying most files

                        that was interfering with the update of balena-lint

              hash: 12a0940ce31031e203364dd6c76a4fc07697133b

                The supervisor will now write the following dtoverlay setting

                "gpio-key,gpio=4,active_low=0,gpio_pull=down"

                into config.txt in the following form:

                dtoverlay=gpio-key
                dtparam=gpio=4
                dtparam=active_low=0
                dtparam=gpio_pull=down

                So we need to rework the test to account for these changes.

                a203bcdfd567c0cc4b4ed9de493513142cd7463f introduced a dependency

                on /usr/sbin/balena-config-defaults to hostapp-update-hooks,
                however

                during HUP the script is not only executed in the "new" OS
                container

                but directly in the context of the "old" OS as well, so

                /usr/sbin/balena-config-defaults needs to exist there.

                The file was introduced in balenaOS v2.99.28, so trying to HUP

                from anything before that will fail.


                This patch changes this to a soft dependency so even if the file

                is missing HUP will continue.

              hash: e984b21b0270729784735d99f222294be65afd20

                At this moment resin_update_state_probe looks for the root
                partition

                by UUID and assumes that only a single device is returned. This

                assumption breaks when the root is on a MD RAID1 device as not
                only

                the virtual MD device holds a filesystem with the given UUID,

                each member does as well.


                This patch makes resin_update_state_probe ignore devices

                that are RAID members which in that case will only return

                the MD device as expected.

                Currently devices with on-board storage fail to build in jenkins, if they don't provide a flasher image. One example is the CM4. Since there are multiple devices using this configuration, let's re-enable builds for all of them.

                        RPI firmware configuration allows repeating overlays to
                        define

                        configurations on multiple devices. For instance, for
                        configuring

                        multiple `ads` devices, `config.txt` needs to be setup
                        this way


                        ```

                        dtoverlay=ads1115,addr=0x48

                        dtoverlay=ads1115,addr=0x49

                        ```


                        Before this change, the supervisor would interpret both
                        lines as

                        belonging to the same overlay, preventing users from
                        configuring multiple

                        devices, and leading to a loop when trying to apply
                        configurations with

                        repeated overlays coming from the cloud side.

                        Rsync (v2) deltas have been broken since [Supervisor v14](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/commit/460c3ba0aab31d18a02e3f5dda1838691768c494). While considered legacy,
                        they are still used by a few customers with devices running OS < 2.47.1.
                        This should fix v2 delta support for those devices until we can
                        completely remove rsync deltas from the supervisor

                        Previously, getBootConfig() of the config.txt backend
                        was omitting

                        array configurations such as gpio settings, thus
                        resulting in the SV

                        mistakenly assuming that boot config had not been
                        applied, since gpio

                        would not be in current config.txt config but would be
                        in target config.

                        This resulted in SV entering an infinite loop of
                        attempting to apply the

                        gpio config when it wasn't necessary.

                        While ordering is important in the RPI firmware configuration file (config.txt),
                        some dt params are by default considered part of the base dt overlay
                        if they are not used by other overlays.
                        Unfortunately the [list of dtparams](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/README#L133)
                        is too long to add all of them as exceptions, but we can add the params
                        used in the default config.txt provided in OS images, to avoid reboots
                        when updating to this new supervisor and correctly parsing the
                        provisioning config.txt as variables.

                        While this addition handles most common scenarios, there is still a
                        chance a user may have use other base overlay dt params in the initial
                        config, in which case those will be interpreted according to the
                        relative ordering

                        DT overlays and DT params need to be consumed in the
                        order that they

                        appear on the file. DT params apply to the last
                        dtoverlay defined on the

                        file, or to the base overlay.


                        This commit updates config.txt parsing to consider this
                        ordering, and it

                        also ensures global dtparams are written first so they
                        cannot be

                        overriden by later overlays.


                        Because of the more strict parsing method, it is
                        possible that existing

                        HOST_CONFIG vars do not match the interpretation of the
                        parser. If

                        that's the case, the supervisor will re-apply the target
                        state which

                        will cause the device to reboot.

                During HUP, rollback-health-breadcrumb and
                rollback-altboot-breadcrumb

                are created in the state partition to trigger rollback-health
                and

                rollback-altboot respectively on the next boot. After these
                services

                complete, they will remove these breadcrumbs.


                Make the broken init fallback tests wait for these services to
                become

                inactive before testing the state of the breadcrumbs. Otherwise,
                a race

                condition can make these tests fail. Most notably on slower
                systems,

                such as emulated generic-aarch64.

              hash: 4b1bc7244ab21a9952ea7569c0c0e1bc9a11e2e0
              body: >
                The balena bootloader initramfs contains the rootfs module and
                that

                will get the rootfs mounted but not checked first for errors.
                This is

                problematic because at first boot with network connectivity
                available,

                time will sync but the rootfs will still have the last mount
                time in

                1970. If at that point the rootfs gets corrupted then at next
                boot

                the rootfs' initramfs module from balena-bootloader will try to
                mount

                the rootfs without checking it first and then after that the
                filesystem

                check triggered by the fsck module from the actual kernel
                initramfs will

                fail like this:


                [init][INFO] Running filesystem checks on partition resin-rootA
                (/dev/disk/by-state/resin-rootA)

                resin-rootA contains a file system with errors, check forced.

                resin-rootA: Inodes that were part of a corrupted orphan linked
                list found.


                resin-rootA: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.
                        (i.e., without -a or -p options)

                This commit will add the fsck module to balena bootloader's
                initramfs

                which will trigger filesystem checks before the rootfs module
                runs.

                This fixes rollback-health failures for boards like the Jetson
                Seeeed

                J4012, which updates efivars for capsule updates from container
                hooks

                and not from the current OS hooks.


                While the actual HUP works because of /sys being bindmounted by

                hostapp-update, rollbacks will fail to run the old OS hooks
                unless

                efivarfs is mounted.

        Move the SOC_MACHINE setting before the MACHINEOVERRIDES immediate
        assignment so it gets taken into account when setting MACHINEOVERRIDES.

        Otherwise the `revpi` machine override gets lost.

                        Moby v25 adds the dynamically generated MAC address to
                        the Config field,

                        which breaks the state engine, preventing the state from
                        settling as the

                        current state never matches the target state (empty mac
                        address). This

                        seems to be a bug in Moby that we reported in
                        moby/moby#47228


                        The issue won't affect Balena devices until balenaEngine
                        is updated, and this

                        change fixes testing for now.

                The class will perform a basic configuration of a linux kernel

                to be used as the balena bootloader. Device types are expected

                to inherit it and perform additional device-specific
                configuration.

                The kexec initrd script currently removes the maxcpus=0 kernel
                arg

                which we use to put the system into non-SMP mode. This however
                does

                not work on all platforms and nr_cpus=1 seems to be a more
                robust

                solution, so with this patch nr_cpus will be removed as well.

                chain"
              hash: 089f4d639383a4981d4840f9e22cccc97270b339
              body: >
                At this moment there is a race condition between NetworkManager

                and the engine when a shared interface is configured. If the
                interface

                is configured first and the engine second, the containers are
                allowed

                to access DHCP hosts behind the shared interface. If the engine
                comes

                up first and the shared interface second, access will be denied.


                This patch adds a dispatcher script that always configures the
                firewall

                rules as if the engine came up last. This does not really
                address

                the underlying issue but it overcomes the race condition and
                makes

                the behavior deterministic, which is good enough at this point.

    - subject: configure panic on hung tasks and extend timeout
      hash: 6cf23e1245a3590ebfe966e728901369bc7b5621
      body: |
        On long run reboot tests we have seen devices get stuck on reboot
        when systemd-shutdown hangs and systemd is still refreshing the
        hardware watchdog. Those devices are unreachable until power cycled.

        To avoid this, we configure the devices to panic on hung task detection
        which will reboot the device. However, as we know the engine might hang
        itself when pulling big images, we also extend the timeout from 2m to 4m
        to try and avoid this.

                We've noticed that leaving the host discoverable indefinitely on
                Pi3 Autokit hosts solves sporadic scan failures. Thus, leaving
                the host discoverable for 20 minutes should be sufficient to
                prevent these cases.

                        This is meant to allow users to configure their device
                        to

                        resolve `.local` queries via dnsmasq by modifying
                        config.json, e.g. `dnsServers":

                        "/bob.local/172.17.0.33`.


                        This would fail before as MDNS lookups would always come
                        first

                      hash: 3ea8d4727a4f4b068b308d1f407b7cf0dae2733b

                        The `updateMetadata` step renames the container to match
                        the target

                        release when the service doesn't change between
                        releases. We have seen

                        this step fail because of an engine bug that seems to
                        relate to the

                        engine keeping stale references after container
                        restarts. The only way

                        around this issue is to remove the old container and
                        create it again.

                        This implements that workaround during the
                        updateMetadata step to deal

                        with that issue.

                There have been reports of an empty config vars cache file -
                probably

                because of a race condition when the reading of config.json
                happens just

                as the file is being replaced.


                Add some checks and retries to avoid this errors from happening.

                The log files are kept in the /run partition that also houses
                the udev database.

                By moving the /run partition to $ROOTFS_DIR/run in the migrate
                module, the udev database persists across reboots.

                The udevcleanup module was introduced to cleanup the database
                so it's regenerated on the final rootfs as the rules are
                different between initramfs and final rootfs. By moving /run
                before udevcleanup ran, the cleanup was not effective.

                This commit moves the relocation of the /run mount to the
                finish module, after udevcleanup is run, and groups it with
                the other relocations needed for the pivot switch.

                Looking at git history, the relocation of the /run partition
                was initially done in the rootfs module, so when the migrate
                module was introduced and needed to mount the rootfs, this
                relocation was just moved into the migration module itself,
                without considering later modules like finish.

                This provides an easy switch to enable tracing on HUP hooks that
                works

                both on old and new OS hooks as enabling it depends on a
                config.json

                setting.


                It is meant to debug field issues with HUP failure where all we
                see is:

                ```

                Before hooks (old os) ran successfully

                Failed to run the new hooks. Running current hooks..

    - subject: remove migrator module for revpi family
      hash: ed8d120c754e130b2409562a4e97c774c9c9dab3
      body: |
        The Revolution Pi are particular devices as they define an
        internal storage in the contract, but they do not use a flasher
        image and instead rely on the bootloader's exposing the internal
        storage.

        However, resin-init-flasher has a built time check for all devices
        that define internal storage to define INTERNAL_DEVICE_KERNEL, so the
        build fails when initramfs-framework builds the resin-init-flasher
        dependency.

        The lack of a `jq` dependency on earlier versions of meta-balena
        meant that the check was non-operative, but it started failing when
        the dependency was added.

        This commit removes the migrator module from being built and included
        in the initramfs.

                Detecting whether the script is running in a PID namespace by
                checking

                `/proc/1/sched` does not work for newer kernels

                (see https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/17917).


                Properly detecting this is too cumbersome for a bash logging
                script,

                see https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/17902, however,
                falling

                back to the last check, that is, seeing if `/.dockerenv` exists
                is easy

                enough and works for our use case.


                This script will only be called from the hostOS, and the only
                case it is

                called from a container is during HUP and the container is
                always a hostOS

                image. So even though the interface chosen by moby, a file under
                /,

                is a bad interface in general, it works fine for the specific
                limitations

                of balenaOS.


                Also, check for `/run/.containerenv` which is the equivalent
                interface

                for podman for future proofing.

                        Whenever the Supervisor reports current state, it diffs
                        the current state

                        with its last reported current state. However, when the
                        Supervisor starts

                        up, there is no last reported state, since that last
                        report is stored in

                        process memory. Caching the last report in a location
                        that survives

                        Supervisor restarts will reduce the current report
                        bandwidth used on startup.

                We add a script which can be replaced by device repositories
                to implement device-specific healthchecks. One usecase for this
                test is the Jetson UEFI firmware update check,
                but can be extended to all other devices as needed.

                We previously tried to use a single time limit for the execution
                of the

                healthcheck test on all device types. This was causing
                occasional false

                positives in our Continuous Integration pipeline, though --
                especially

                on slow devices like Pi Zeros and the generic-aarch64, which
                runs on

                emulated hardware.


                This commit addresses this issue, this commit:


                1. Limits execution for device types for which we have collected
                enough
                   data to have a good idea of how long the test should take.
                2. Uses time limits specific for each device type.

                        PR #2217 removed the expose configuration but also
                        caused a regresion

                        where ports set via the `ports` configuration would no
                        longer get

                        exposed to the host, despite portmappings being set.
                        This fixes that

                        issue by exposing only those ports comming from port
                        mappings.

                        The docker EXPOSE directive and corresponding
                        docker-compose `expose`

                        service configuration serves as documentation/metadata
                        that a container

                        listens on a certain port that may be used for service
                        discovery but it doesn't

                        have any real impact on the ability for

                        other containers on the same network to access the
                        exposed service via

                        the port. In newer engine implementations, this property
                        may conflict

                        with other network configurations, and prevent the
                        container from being

                        started by the docker engine (see #2211).


                        This PR removes code that would manage the expose
                        property and takes the

                        property out of the whitelist. A composition with the
                        `expose` property

                        will result in the log message `Ignoring unsupported or
                        unknown compose fields: expose`.


                        While this change should not have operational impact, it
                        still removes

                        a previously supported configuration and as such there
                        is a chance of it

                        being a breaking change for some applications. For this
                        reason it is

                        being published as a new major version.

                The code moved from meta-balena-kirkstone was not really
                specific to

                kirkstone so let's move it here so that future branches for
                newer yocto

                releases which we'll base off kirkstone don't continue to add
                this

                unneeded  duplication.

                There are other meta-balena-* directories that still contain the

                duplication we moved from meta-balena-kirkstone but we're not
                really

                concerned with that because going forward those old directories
                will

                naturally get deprecated.

                If the target supervisor image is already cached but there is no

                container running with it, the update script would just exit
                without

                actually running the target supervisor.


                This commit checks whether there is a running container using
                the

                target image and restarts the supervisor if there is none.

                During installation, some firmwares may allow keys to be

                fail to tip the system into user mode until the system is
                rebooted. We

                don't want to mislead users with only full-disk encryption into
                thinking

                their system also has secure boot enabled when it doesn't.


                Disable the hook to unlock encrypted partitions if the firmware
                fails to

                boot into user mode.

                This flag isn't needed on balenaOS as the splash screen
                remains even after plymouthd is stopped.

                Having the flag in place prevents user apps from writing to
                tty consoles after stopping plymouth via dbus.

                        This reverts commit
                        0c7bad779291e15e419166a2c66c2a21dd06aa83, as that

                        change causes a service restart loop. The supervisor
                        cannot distinguish

                        between ports exposed via the `EXPOSE` directive and the
                        docker-compose

                        `expose` property. Because of this, in the case of
                        `network-mode:

                        service:<...>` the current state and target state never
                        match, leading

                        to a service restart loop.

                        The supervisor exposes ports configured using the
                        `EXPOSE` directive in

                        the dockerfile when configuring the container for
                        runtime. This can

                        cause issues if using `network_mode: service:<service
                        name>` as the

                        expose configuration is not compatible with that network
                        mode. This

                        fix now skips image exposed ports for that particular
                        network mode.

                When searching for devices matching the glob list in

                get_internal_device(), a glob match breaks from a nested loop
                rather

                than the parent loop, allowing the function to output multiple
                matches.


                When running the flasher, this results in the script failing
                with an

                incorrect path to the internal disk.


                Break from the parent loop to fix this behavior.

                This is done by the bootloader (uboot/grub) at this moment but
                as we

                are moving towards the balena 2nd stage bootloader, it needs to
                be

                moved into the initramfs.


                This adds a standalone recipe - by default yocto tries to build
                all

                modules defined in the initramfs-framework recipe, which breaks

                on armv7 when abroot is defined there. This is because it
                depends

                on grub-editenv which is not supported on armv7.

                The rootfs script uses both os-helpers-fs and os-helpers-logging

                though the package depends on neither. This seems to work now
                because

                in most cases something else pulls in the dependencies or the
                code

                on a particular device does not fall under the branches that use

                the missing functions.

                        This commit updates balena-containerd to a new version
                        in which we

                        cherry-picked the change from here:
                        https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/8086


                        This change avoids enabling AppArmor if the
                        `/sbin/apparmor_parser`

                        binary is not found in the system.

                Yocto Pyro, so stop trying to apply bbappend to it from

              hash: 0b246409da5359741138a81b552fcc6bb3ecc24e

                314047e and b5c5214 made flasher block until the
                resin-device-register

                service exits and made resin-device-register give up after 6
                seconds

                not to block infinitely when no network is available. This
                effectively

                means that if the device fails to register within first 6
                seconds,

                it will never retry, flasher will not report status to the
                dashboard

                and the device will only register on first boot.


                This patch changes the logic back to resin-device-register
                trying

                in the background in an infinite loop and moves the "give the
                device

                a chance to register" delay to flasher itself. It also extends

                the wait to openvpn as flasher already does that and wants VPN
                to run

                to be debuggable - in case flashing fails, it would be possible

                to SSH in via the VPN and look at the logs remotely.

                The kernel-balena class contains:

                CONIFG_SECURITY=n


                which is mispelled and not being applied. The commit where this
                was

                introduced claims it's needed to completely disable the audit
                logs, and

                also that the security framework is unused.


                I disagree in that it's unused - the hostOS is not using any
                security

                framework, but applications may, so luckily the security
                framework was

                never disabled.


                Removing this mispelled entry should have no functional effect.
                Whether

                the audit subsystem is disabled will depend on the final kernel

                configuration. Definitely we have not seen a need to disable it
                recently,

                and we have not seen the kernel log flooded with messages.


                I'd argue the disabling of the audit subsystem in meta-balena
                serves no

                need but I also have no specific reason to remove it at the
                moment.

            - subject: "grub-conf: Do not hardcode the path for grub_extraenv"
              hash: f7ec67bd53e0998c12bcbdcaccea99f1f6856bcf
              body: >
                At this moment grub.cfg sources /grub/grub_extraenv which works
                fine

                on MBR systems, however on EFI systems this does not work
                because GRUB

                is installed in /EFI/BOOT/ rather than /grub/.


                This patch replaces the hardcoded /grub with ${prefix} which
                should

                expand to the appropriate directory regardless of the platform.
                It also

                removes the loading of grub_extraenv from the secure boot
                variant

                of the GRUB config since this would not load without a signature
                anyway.

                The imx8mm-var-dart-plt also uses a custom implementation
                for detecting the boot switch, so let's make use of the
                existing support in meta-balena for the testbot provisioning
                use-case and add this DT in the Autokit.

                GitHub App installation tokens are short-lived and do not
                need to be rotated the same way PATs do.

                The default app ID and installation ID correspond to
                flowzone-bot[app] installed in the balena-os Org.

                cryptsetup lazily depends on libgcc. With libgcc missing,
                certain

                operations, especially luksOpen will fail with

                `libgcc_s.so.1 must be installed for pthread_exit to work`

                which panics the kernel and triggers a reboot loop
                indistinguishable

                from a "device has been tampered with" state on regular builds

                with no console output.

                Kexec is used to boot into the decrypted kernel in the hostapp
                on

                systems with secure boot and full-disk encryption.


                If kexec fails, we don't want to continue with the rest of the
                boot

                process in the first stage kernel, so bail out on failure.

                Adapted as a bbappend from:
                https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/commit/meta/recipes-kernel/linux/kernel-devsrc.bb?id=2be1b5d7d38d72c35ec593b98366d128fe5ce12c

                The 6.1 kernel has a number of Kbuild and architecture changes
                that required us to update our devsrc recipe. With these changes
                we are once again able to build on target modules for all
                supported archectures.

                        It's not an official status from container inspects, and
                        the Supervisor

                        doesn't set it internally anywhere. It's better to
                        remove it entirely as the

                        method by which Supervisor sets internal service
                        statuses is by using a global

                        event emitter (reportNewStatus) which makes things
                        difficult to test.

                We have seen devices that won't change PCR1 hash when a
                temporary boot

                order override was applied or secure boot was disabled via BIOS
                setup.

                The implementation of what PCR1 actually measures is very

                device-specific, but many of the risks can be mitigated by
                setting up

                a BIOS password and disabling F-key shortcuts for interacting
                with

                the firmware.

                Both `kernel-modules-headers` and `kernel-devsrc` provide kernel
                headers

                since Yocto Thud switched `kernel-devsrc` from full source to
                just

                kernel headers.


                The only difference between them is that
                `kernel-modules-headers` builds

                some target binaries which need to be built with `make
                modules_prepare`

                when using `kernel-devsrc` headers. These binaries depend on
                libc version

                matching though so they have shown to be problematic.


                This commit removes the `kernel-modules-headers` recipe and
                modifies

                `kernel-devsrc` to replace it. The deployed artifact remains
                named as

                `kernel-modules-headers` as it's a more descriptive name.


                This introduces a breaking change in the balenaOS API as
                customers that

                are using `kernel-modules-headers` to build external kernel
                modules will

                now need to issue a `make modules_prepare` as part of their
                build scripts.

                      hash: 71d24d6e3366b28e1466e99322d58420b5ebbb67
                      body: >
                        The previous implementation in #2170 of parsing the
                        container status was too general,

                        because it relied on the mistaken assumption that a
                        container would have a status of

                        `Stopped` if it was manually stopped. This turned out to
                        be untrue, as manually stopped

                        containers were also getting restarted by the Supervisor
                        due to their inspect status of

                        `exited`. With this, parsing the exit message became
                        unavoidable as there are no other

                        clear ways to discern a container that has been manually
                        stopped and shouldn't be started

                        from a container experiencing the Engine-host race
                        condition issue (again, see #2170).


                        Since we're just parsing the exit error message, we
                        don't need to worry about different behaviors

                        amongst restart policies, as any container with the
                        error message on exit should be started.

                        Previously, `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()` would
                        incorrectly return

                        an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF` if the last read from the
                        second concatenated

                        `Reader` didn't completely fill the passed buffer.


                        For instance:


                        ```
                              First Reader    Second Reader
                            |aaaaaaaaaaaaa|bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb|      <--- concatReadSeekCloser
                            |--- previously read ---|--- buffer ---| <--- last read
                                                              |xxxx| <--- "excess" buffer
                        ```


                        In this example, we have a `concatReadSeekCloser` that
                        concatenates two

                        `Reader`s (`aaa...` and `bbb...`). The last `Read()`
                        used a buffer

                        larger than the yet-to-be-read portion of the `bbb...`.
                        So, it would

                        incorrectly return an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`.


                        This commit makes sure that last `Read()` returns all
                        the remaining data

                        without an error. It also adds various test cases for

                        `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()`, many of which would fail
                        before this

                        correction.


                        Interestingly, this bug was silently affecting us. Not
                        in a fatal way,

                        but causing deltas to be larger than necessary. Indeed,
                        running

                        `TestDeltaSize` after this commit shows that some test
                        cases are

                        producing deltas smaller than what we expected before.
                        For posterity,

                        see all the details below.


                        We use `concatReadSeekCloser`s to concatenate all layers
                        of the basis

                        image when creating the "signature" of the basis image.
                        In this process,

                        the `concatReadSeekCloser`s are wrapped around by a
                        buffered reader with

                        a buffer of 65kB.


                        If, in any read, part of this 65kB buffer was beyond the
                        second

                        concatenated reader, it would result in an
                        `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`. This

                        would not cause the whole process to fail, but would
                        prematurely end the

                        signature generation: some of the final blocks in the
                        basis image would

                        not be added to the signature. Therefore, if those
                        blocks appeared in

                        the target image, they'd result in (larger) LITERAL,
                        instead of

                        (smaller) COPY operations.


                        For illustration, here's the delta generated for the
                        `delta-006-008`

                        test case. First before this commit:

                        That 21kB LITERAL is the difference in size we saw in
                        the test results.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are
                        mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images,
                        particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf
                        built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the
                        docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the
                        manifest.

                LUKS2 formatting and adds conversion to LUKS2 to the cryptsetup

                initrd script.

                This helper command saves and compares crc32 sum for a memory
                area where the kernel image or the device-tree is loaded.

                Can be used after loading the kernel and the dtb, and also prior
                to calling booti.

        all new RPI4 based machines will inherit the raspberrypi4-64 machine.

                        restart policy
                      hash: 7f3214195838a8bf3242ef7540b4487338687e4c
                      body: >
                        There exists a race condition between Engine and a host
                        resource that may not

                        be immediately created. In this race condition, if a
                        container's compose config

                        depends on the existence of that host resource, such as
                        a network interface, and the

                        Engine tries to create & start the container before the
                        host resource is created, the

                        Engine will not reattempt to start the container,
                        regardless of the restart policy.

                        This is undesireable behavior but seems to be the
                        behavior as implemented by Docker.


                        To rectify this, the Supervisor state funnel noops for a
                        grace period of 1 minute

                        after starting a container to see that the container's
                        status has become 'running`.

                        If the container exits because of the race condition,
                        the status becomes 'exited' and the

                        Supervisor will attempt to generate another start step.
                        This noop-wait-start step loop

                        will repeat until the container is able to start.


                        If the container is never able to start, there was a
                        problem in the host in the creation of the

                        host resource, and that should be fixed at the host
                        level.


                        This commit does not handle the case of services with
                        restart policies "no" or "on-failure"

                        which encounter this host race, as metadata from
                        container inspects needs to be introduced

                        during step calculation in order to figure out whether
                        services with those restart policies

                        need to be started. This will be fixed in a future PR.

                This commit adds a check for the script to exists instead of
                getting a

                `command not found` when an API endpoint is defined.

                The purpose of testing the API calls is to detect breaking
                changes, not

                to fail builds because of temporary network or API access
                problems.


                Printing a warning instead should be enough for developers to
                detect

                breaking changes.

        Backporting to ESR branches hits a flowzone error as both pull_request

        and pull_request_target run and this only works for master.


        Removing the pull_request_target run for ESR branches fixes this, but

        also removes the possibility of external pull requests into ESR
        branches,

        which we don't actually need.

                Comply with AWS public AMI quota, taking into account we have
                two

                custom

                version request.


                Make the oldest public image back to private before publishing a
                new image.

                When parsing additional variables to be passed to the bitbake
                build,

                keys and values are split using equals as a delimiter. However,
                the

                splitting process does not split only on the first occurrence,
                which

                results in removing equals signs from the value as well. This is

                problematic with base64 encoded strings, which are padded with
                equals

                signs.


                Split only on the first occurrence, leaving the value intact.

                When programming keys for secure boot, some devices do not clear

                the setup mode flag after a new PK is installed. In this case

                flasher will reboot in order to ensure the keys are actually
                saved

                and the device comes back with secure boot enabled. Since we
                changed

                flasher to be unsigned by default, this reboot causes a security

                violation.


                With this patch flasher will add a new boot entry before issuing

                the reboot so that signed flasher comes up and the installation
                process

                can continue.

                Currently the db.auth file is signed as "append" in order to
                make HUP work.

                Most UEFI firmwares will accept such file even for "replace",
                which we do

                during the initial provisioning, however we have seen devices
                that will

                only allow appending, which makes flasher fail.


                With this patch flasher will use the esl file for initial
                programming

                of the db variable.


                PK and KEK are unaffected.

                        Previously, we'd time-out a pull operation after
                        unsuccessfully retrying

                        for about 17 minutes (for details see commit

                        582487f832c59c2f734a780ab0492833f29002c9). This worked
                        fine in most

                        situations, but we have seen at least one case of a
                        particularly

                        unreliable network connection that would not be able to
                        finish a large

                        pull when operating under this policy.


                        This commit:


                        * Completely removes timeouts from image pulls. We'll
                        keep retrying
                          forever, or until users cancel the pull. (From the perspective of the
                          REST API, "canceling" mean closing the HTTP connection. This is what
                          happens when a user Ctrl+C during a pull in the CLI, or, say, we kill
                          a curl process that was using the REST API to pull image.)
                        * Still uses exponential back-off, but we now limit the
                        interval between
                          retries to 5 minutes. The rationale is that some very unreliable
                          networks may be up only for relatively small time windows. Therefore,
                          using intervals that are too long would increase the risk of missing
                          these windows.
                        * Tries to avoid flooding the log stream with messages
                        about retries.
                          We'll log every retry attempt up to the 10th. After that, we'll log
                          retries only once about every 2h. This retry count is reset every time
                          we successfully download any amount of data.

                        Read the suite configuration for the force migration
                        flag which configures

                        the flasher image to force an installer migration.


                        With the current QEMU setting, `installerForceMigration`
                        alone is not

                        enough and the QEMU_INTERNAL_STORAGE also needs to be
                        set to false in

                        the worker's environment so only a single external disk
                        is attached to

                        the emulator.

        The linux-kunbus kernel recipe includes the file linux-raspberrypi.inc
        which is present in the BSP layer. As such we also need to add here
        the kernel config fragment(s) the BSP include file uses.

        These were brought in when we added the raspberrypi kernel in our layer.
        Since we now use the kernel from the BSP layer, let's remove these files
        from here since they are already in the BSP layer.

                        After a recent change enforcing all the partitions to be
                        on the same

                        block device, encrypted partitions are no longer being
                        detected

                        correctly. This is because the assumption that the
                        parent block device

                        is a substring of the actually mounted block device does
                        not work

                        for LUKS devices - the mount will either be
                        /dev/mapper/luks-XXX

                        or /dev/dm-X while the parent device is still e.g.
                        /dev/sda.


                        The usual balenaOS boot partition is also split in two -
                        boot and efi.

                        The boot partition (mounted under /mnt/boot) is
                        encrypted and the efi

                        partition (mounted under /mnt/efi) is not.


                        This patch generalizes the detection of the parent
                        device so that

                        it works with both encrypted and unencrypted partitions.

                        The docker compose V2 spec no longer accepts

                        the `balena-supervisor` service for tests.


                        For this reason we now create a separate service to run
                        the built

                        supervisor `balena-supervisor-sut` and run API tests
                        against this

                        service instead of the default `balena-supervisor`.

                At this moment if the cryptsetup initrd script executes before
                the root

                device comes up (e.g. when booting off a USB disk), it assumes

                that encryption is not in place because it was not able to find

                the EFI partition.


                This patch adds a wait4file loop to the script that waits

                for the /dev/disk/by-state directory. This is not tied to any
                particular

                partition or device but since the directory does not exist by
                default

                and is only created by a custom balenaOS udev rule, its
                existence

                implies that the rule fired and a device with balenaOS
                partitions

                is present in the system.

                        A bug in service comparison would make it that a device
                        already running

                        a service from a new release with network changes would
                        never stop the

                        running service so remaining services would forever get
                        stuck in

                        `Downloaded` state.


                        This fixes the comparison so the service will get killed
                        in this case,

                        Previous behavior would make it that an `updateMetadata`

                        network and a container change.

                        These tests use the supervisor API to check that
                        applying a target state

                        allows the device to eventually get to the desired
                        target configuration.


                        This are high-level tests that work with real images and
                        containers

                        using dind.

                A safe copy would only work for files that are read by fatrw
                also and that is

                not the case for boot files. Still, some file like `config.json`
                would

                benefit from a safe copy so we still try that first.


                Fixes #2998

                If a safe copy is preferred but non-critical, the unsafe fatrw
                command

                can be used and if fatrw does not have enough resources to make
                a safe

                copy it will fallback to a standard cp.


                This is useful when performing hostOS updates for example where
                a safe

                copy would only work for files that are read by fatrw also and
                that is

                        The actions now work by passing an intermediate state to
                        the state

                        engine.


                        - doPurge first removes the user app from the target
                        state and passes
                          that to the state engine for purging. Since intermediate state doesn't
                          remove images, this will have the effect of basically re-installing
                          the app.

                        - doRestart modifies the target state by first removing
                        only the
                          services from the current state but keeping volumes and networks. This
                          has the same effect as before where services were stopped one by one

                        There were multiple places in the state engine that
                        skipped some

                        operations while in local mode. In reality, all it's
                        needed while in

                        local mode is to skip image and volume deletion.


                        This commit simplifies application-manager and compose
                        app to be more

                        local mode agnostic and instead making the image
                        deletion and volume

                        deletion configurable via function arguments.


                        This also has the benefit to make the treatment of local
                        mode

                        applications more similar to cloud mode applications,
                        allowing for

                        API endpoints to function the same way both modes.

                This patch changes the validation of bootable images from
                certificate

                signatures to a list of allowed hashes of binaries. This only
                applies

                on db level, PK and KEK are still certificates.


                The motivation is that certificates expire and we need to be
                sure

                that even devices that have been lying on a shelf for several
                years

                or whose CMOS battery has died and reset date to 1970-01-01 are
                still

                bootable. Using hashes is more aligned with this use-case and
                also

                more similar to the approach that embedded SoCs use.

                Shipping a single image with signature checks enabled will
                enforce

                the signatures on non-secure-boot systems as well. GRUB does not
                have

                a simple method to check whether secure boot is enabled that
                could

                be embedded with the default built-in config.


                With this patch we build two separate images - one enforcing

                the signatures and the other one not, keeping the original
                behavior.

                HUP and flasher both can detect if secure boot is enabled so
                they

                put the correct image in place when installing/updating GRUB.

                        Node 15 [changed the way it treats unhandled promise rejections](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V15.md#throw-on-unhandled-rejections---33021) from a warning to a throw.
                        For this reason errors like a corrupt migration directory, that happens when trying to
                        roll back to a previous supervisor version were no longer showing a
                        message but dumping the full minimized code into the journal logs.

                        This PR adds a catchall on app.ts to log the exception and throw an exit
                        code of 1.

                        Restart-service checks that both services have restarted in its test assertion, which is
                        incorrect as restart-service should only restart one service.

                      hash: 49ee1042a87ce0b101054e32b84afaa324a371de
                      body: >
                        As the Supervisor is a privileged container, it has
                        access to host /dev, and therefore has access

                        to boot, data, and state balenaOS partitions. This
                        commit sets up the framework for the following:


                        - Finds the /dev partition that corresponds to each
                        partition based on partition label

                        - Mounts the partitions into set mountpoints in the
                        device

                        - Removes reliance on env vars and mountpoints provided
                        by host's start-balena-supervisor script

                        - Simplifies host path querying by centralizing these
                        queries through methods in lib/host-utils.ts


                        This particular changes env vars for and mounts the boot
                        partition.


                        Since the Supervisor would no longer rely on container
                        `run` arguments provided by a host script,

                        this change moves Supervisor closer to being able to
                        start itself (Supervisor-as-an-app).

                        Notable improvements these new versions bring:


                        * Optimized code path for generating deltas with blocks
                        that are
                          power-of-two-sized.
                        * Avoid allocating unbounded amounts of memory when the
                        target differs
                          completely from the source.
                        * Several bugfixes in edge cases that shall not affect
                        balenaEngine.

                Setting `LimitCORE=0` will avoid the creation of core dump files
                on

                containers. This will avoid cases in which a crashlooping user
                app ends

                up filling up the entire storage with dump files.


                Users can re-enable core dumps in their services by manually
                setting the

                `ulimits.core`. For example:


                ```

                services:
                  my-service:
                    ulimits:
                      core: -1
                ```


                (Where -1 is used to mean "unlimited")

                Setting `Delegate=yes` ensures that systemd will not change anything on
                the cgroups created for running the containers.

                This setting is used upstream since this commit:
                https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/d16737f971092767c1b9d28302a3f5aedbe2f576

                        The original delta code on the `xfer` package used to
                        set `d.err` when

                        an unexpected EOF was found in the delta tar stream.
                        Turns out `d.err`

                        would end up being overwritten before it was read, so
                        that initial

                        assignment was effectively a no-op.


                        This commit simplifies the code a little bit by removing
                        this bogus

                        assignment and also improves the error reporting a notch
                        by adding more

                        context to the error messages.

                        was a good deal of duplication.

                        This factors out portions of the `distribution` package,
                        so that we can

                        reuse this functionality between `balena pull` and
                        `balena load`. There

                        was a good deal of duplication.


                        This piece of code is tricky to factor out into a
                        separate function.

                        Basically we had two options:


                        1. Create a completely reusable, DRY function that
                        encapsulates all the
                           duplicate code. Sounds nice until you noticed that would be a
                           horrendous function with 5 return values and overly obscure
                           semantics.
                        2. We create a small set of functions with clearer
                        interfaces and
                           semantics, but which will still lead to some code duplication between
                           the `pull` and `load` implementations.

                        I opted for the second alternative because the resulting
                        code is much

                        easier to understand and maintain. Also, the remaining
                        duplication is

                        mostly dumb, integration and error handling code that
                        almost writes

                        itself as we call the new reusable functions -- so, this
                        is sort of a

                        benign duplication.

        Newer Revpi machines need a newer kernel. We can't however update all
        the existing revpi machines to the newer kernel because currently the
        altboot rollback test fails for revpi-connect due to the rollback being
        done between too far apart kernel versions (4.19.95 and 5.10.152) and
        there is an inconsistency making the board not boot ok with older kernel
        from the rootfs and the newer devices trees with newer boot firmware in
        the boot partition.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are
                        mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images,
                        particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf
                        built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the
                        docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the
                        manifest.

                        A couple of changes here:


                        * Check for sudo necessity and availability before doing
                        any real work.
                          Better to warn and exit quick and early!
                        * Remove the support for using `su`. It was broken for
                        two reasons.
                          First, unlike `sudo`, `su -c` expects the command as a single
                          argument. Second, `su`, unlike `sudo`, reads the password from stdin
                          which in this case "contains" the tarball being downloaded. The second
                          point is particularly tricky to solve without saving the tarball to
                          storage (and we want to avoid extra storage space and wear). And,
                          anyway, users that can `su -c` can also `su` manually before
                          installing.

                        * Fix the actual check. We previously used `[ $abort ]

                The patch applied to systemd addressed this upstream moby issue:
                https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/27202

                This was fixed in containerd 1.0.2:
                https://github.com/containerd/console/pull/10/commits/c358734ec94e72903243bd1c9034874a1de09424

                This fix is present in balena engine since v17.13.5, which has been in
                use since commit 53ce147. Drop this patch from meta-balena-dunfell and
                later.

                Certain services, such as getty@.service, and
                systemd-logind.service are

                disabled when running in a container using a patch to the source
                files.

                This increases the manual intervention necessary when adding
                support for

                a new version of systemd. Replace the patch with drop-in
                configs.

                        Some incoming tests require QEMU to exit, simulating a
                        device powering

                        off, before starting QEMU again. This is used to
                        "reflash" a virtualized

                        device before continuing with testing, for instance
                        after tampering with

                        boot files on a secure boot enabled device to verify
                        secure boot checks.


                        However, swtpm will exit when QEMU disconnects. The
                        `--exit-code-from`

                        compose argument implies `--abort-on-container-exit`, so
                        this results

                        in the test run aborting prematurely.


                        Adapt the entrypoint and command of the swtpm container
                        to always

                        restart the program without exiting the container.

                Because we use this patch with various u-boot versions it often
                happens that this patch

                does not apply so we then need to rework it in the device
                integration layer. Instead it

                would be better to have some code at configure time parsing the
                same file and inserting

                the balena env dynamically, so regardless of u-boot versions we
                use.

                        Preloaded devices can require that the device is pinned
                        to the preloaded

                        release on provisioning. However if the provisioned
                        release gets

                        released in the future, that would lead to the device
                        remaining in "VPN

                        only" state forever as the provisioning process could
                        not finish due to

                        pinning failure.


                        This commit changes the behavior so if the release does
                        not exist, the

                        pinning step is skipped and the device follows the fleet
                        pinning state.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are
                        mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images,
                        particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf
                        built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to single-arch solves this as the
                        docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the
                        manifest. Once some

                        of the builder issues are fixed, we should move to #2141

                        The issue with the original Supervisor implementation of
                        the firewall is that

                        on Supervisor start, the Supervisor flushes the INPUT
                        chain of the filter table.

                        This doesn't play well with services that add to the
                        INPUT chain on startup that

                        may start up before the Supervisor, such as certain
                        NetworkManager connection

                        profiles. This change only replaces the BALENA-FIREWALL
                        rule in the INPUT chain,

                        preserving the other rules as well as their order.

              hash: 80d2c45d7318464935516acdc2dd884efaacf31a
              body: >
                In the Internet connection sharing test one of the checks may
                run

                into a racing problem. The following command is holding the
                iptables

                lock for 3 seconds while NetworkManager activates a connection
                with

                sharing enabled:


                `flock /run/xtables.lock sleep 3 & nmcli c up dummy & wait`


                NetworkManager waits for 2 seconds for the lock to be released
                and

                those three seconds should be enough for one of the iptables
                rules

                to fail. However there is no guarantee that NetworkManager will
                start

                adding the iptables rules that quickly - it may start adding
                those

                after one out of those three seconds already passed, which will

                lead to all iptables rules to be set at the end.


                This check is non-essential for the test itself, so it is
                removed with

                this commit.

                unsigned file. With this patch do_install installs the signed

                if available.

                Previously, we bailed out of the installer when the system was
                in user

                mode (keys enrolled) but the user had not opted in to secure
                boot, as it

                was ambiguous whether the user actually wanted SB/FDE.


                However, some systems come with vendor keys pre-enrolled, and a
                user may

                simply turn off secure boot in the firmware setup menu without
                erasing

                the keys. This would result in the installer bailing out even
                though

                secure boot is disabled in the firmware menu.


                Check that secure boot is enabled in addition to having keys
                enrolled

                before bailing out.

                Test for the NetworkManager patch done in

                https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/pull/2963


                A racing condition between balenaEngine and NetworkManager led
                to some Internet

                connection sharing iptables rules not being applied when NM
                connection profile

                with Internet sharing was activated at boot.


                This test checks whether all necessary iptables rules are added
                by artificially

                blocking iptables for 1 second and then for 3 seconds while a
                connection

                profile with Internet sharing is activated.

                - The Jetson TX2 NX has an eMMC and no SD-CARD slot

                - The JN30B Nano uses the eMMC module and not the SD-CARD one

                - The Radxa CM3 on RPI CM4 IOBoard as well as the Radxa zero use
                  rockchip software tools in order to put the eMMC in mass-storage mode
                - The CM4 module comes in two flavors: one with eMMC and the
                Lite version
                  which uses the carrier board sd-card slot to load the image. Both use the
                  same balenaOS image.
                  I switched the storage to internal for this DT because it *may* have
                  one, but this solely depends on the actual module.
                  Another consideration is that this DT can also boot from a USB stick
                  or a NVME drive connected to the mPCIE port.

                We have added DER certificates because it is the only format

                that QEMU/TianoCore accepts in UEFI setup. Since we made setup
                mode

                work properly, there is no need to program the QEMU keys
                manually

                and therefore there is no reason to pollute the boot partition
                with

                the DER files. If indeed necessary, they can always be extracted

                from the ESL, which is still shipped. Shipping the DER files is
                also

                not possible when db uses hashes instead of certificates, which
                we

                want to move towards.

                Previously, it was being referred to only as "balena". Being
                explicit

                that this is about balenaEngine makes it simpler to grep for

                Engine-related portions of balenaOS. Might also help a tad bit
                when

                looking at logs.

                When migrating, we can't assume a device can be remotely powered
                on, so

                finish the flashing with a reboot instead of a shutdown.


                This is possible as the initramfs does not currently have a
                shutdown

                command and avoids the complexity of having to detect whether we
                are

                running from initramfs or not.

                When `recovery` is passed in the kernel command line, the
                initramfs will

                not boot into the OS but launch adbd.


                A connection can then be established via the network (if a DHCP
                address

                is provided) or using a USB gadget connection.


                For a network connection, the client needs to install `adb` and
                run:

                ```

                adb connect $IPADDR:5555

                adb shell

                ```


                Other adb commands, like pull/push of files are also available.

                balenaOS uboot exports specific environment variables

                in resinOS_uEnv.txt and does not have any use-cases of

                saving the entire uboot environment in any device specific

                partitions. This because it relies on the default environment
                being

                stored in the u-boot binary.


                Let's disable the saveenv command and avoid potential incorrect

                usage which may overwrite the partition table, resin-boot
                filesystem

                or other areas of the eMMC that may be pre-configured by the
                BSP.

        According to github action syntax [1], there is no special character
        to denote a match on zero or more of the preceding character, so
        replace `[0-9]?` which only matches zero or one of the preceding
        characters with a `*`.

                Block device nodes are sometimes created without attached media.
                These

                devices can neither be read from, nor written to. In this case,
                the

                flasher will attempt to install to the invalid disk and
                fail.  Detect

                this case and skip the disk to allow flashing to continue.

                        blanket handles all

                        exceptions, and makes debugging and log messages worse.


                        When we don't have a valid way to handle an exception,
                        just throw it.

                        The traceback is more useful than the handler.

                The engine is currently versioned in such a way that upstream
                semver tags are added to branches before merging to master.

                We don't want to try and pin to those commits so only
                consider automated GitHub Releases.

                        We have seen a few times devices with duplicated network
                        names for some

                        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get
                        duplicates, this

                        can be disruptive for updates as trying to create a
                        container referencing a duplicate

                        network results in a 400 error from the engine.


                        This commit finds and removes duplicate networks via the
                        state engine,

                        this means that even if somehow a container could be
                        referencing a

                        network that has been duplicated later somehow, this
                        will remove the

                        container first.


                        While thies doesn't solve the problem of duplicate
                        networks being

                        created in the first place, it will fix the state of the
                        system to

                        correct the inconsistency.

                        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get duplicates,
                        this is disruptive of updates, as the supervisor usually queries
                        resource by name, resulting in a 400 error from the engine because of
                        the ambiguity.

                        This replaces those queries by name to queries by id. This includes
                        network removal. If a `removeNetwork` step is generated, the supervisor
                        opts to remove all instances of the network with the same name as it
                        cannot easily resolve the ambiguity.

                        This doesn't solve the problem of ambiguous networks, because even if
                        networks are referenced by id when creating a container, the engine will
                        throw an error (see https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/issues/590#issuecomment-1423557871)

                The os-helpers scripts are meant to be sourced by other scripts,
                not

                executed. When sourced, the shebang should be ignored.


                However, we have seen instances where a bash script sourcing a
                sh

                os-helper scripts triggers POSIX behaviour, specifically glob
                parsing

                failures.

                When a user runs the flasher with secure boot enabled in
                `config.json`,

                the public keys used to validate the bootloader are enrolled. If
                any

                other bootloader signature fails to validate against this public
                key, it

                won't be executed.


                If the user attempts to run the balenaOS flasher on that system
                again

                without first enabling the secure boot option, the flasher won't
                enroll

                keys, but the installed system will be signed. This will result
                in a

                secure boot enabled system without full-disk encryption.


                Bail out in this case so the user must choose to explicitly
                opt-in to

                secure boot for the new installation, and full-disk encryption
                along

                with it. Otherwise, the user must reset the enrolled keys to
                install

                without secure boot.

                When refactoring secure boot setup, a logic mistake in the
                purpose and

                use of SECUREBOOT_VAR meant that devices booting the flasher
                with keys already

                enrolled would bail out with an incorrect message about secure
                boot not

                being supported in firmware.


                This variable is `00` on systems with secure boot support in
                firmware,

                but not enabled and enforced, `01` on systems where secure boot
                is

                enforced, and empty when secure boot is unsupported.


                Change this conditional to bail out only when the variable is
                empty,

                indicating that secure boot is unsupported.

                        QEMU is capable of using an emulated software TPM
                        exposed via socket. A

                        TPM is necessary for full disk encryption (FDE), so add
                        a service to

                        provide this to the QEMU worker.

              body: >
                get_dev_path_from_label() calls lsblk to get the name and label
                of a

                disk, then filters the list using the label and returns a /dev
                path.


                The name returned when using a luks encrypted partition is the

                /dev/mapper name, rather than the kernel's device mapper name
                under

                /dev/dm-*. When assembling a path under /dev using the luks
                name, the

                path is invalid, and the by-state links aren't created.


                This leads to the rootfs hook failing to find and mount the
                resin-rootA

                partition.


                Change the attribute retrieved using lsblk to kname to fix this.

                The flasher image enrolls the secure boot keys before rebooting
                into

                secured user mode and creating the encrypted luks volumes on
                disk.


                If the image is not signed, the key enrollment will fail, and
                the

                flasher will enter a loop trying to enroll them and rebooting.


                Instead, skip the key enrollment if the image is not signed,
                resulting

                in a non secure-boot installation.

                This allows for the testbot to set resin_flasher_skip=0
                in the extra_uEnv.txt file of the flasher image and
                bypass the boot switch detection mechanisms used for
                specific private device types.

                The boot pins would otherwise prevent the flasher
                from running if they were set to the eMMC position.

                The flasher extra_uEnv.txt file overrides any resin_flasher_skip
                value previously configured by the device integration layer.

                In v2.108.0 we did a major NetworkManager upgrade as we started
                using

                meson as a build system. The connectivity check feature was left

                disabled, which is a regression and it produces fake results.


                This commit enables it back.


                Fixes #2964.

              body: >
                iptables takes a file lock at /run/xtables.lock. By default, if

                the file is locked, iptables will fail with error. When that
                happens,

                the iptables rules won't be configured, and the shared mode

                (for which we use iptables) will not be setup properly.


                Instead, pass "--wait 2", to block.


                The included patch has to be removed once we upgrade to next

                NetworkManager version as it is already included upstream.

                The previous method of disabling NTP by stopping the nameserver

                (dnsmasq) relied on the dnsmasq unit not being reactivated
                before the

                test completed.


                Instead, disable NTP by blocking ntp.org in the local dnsmasq
                instance

                using a dbus method call. NTP is re-enabled as before, by
                restarting

                dnsmasq.

              hash: 345d1440d34fe042f03884c4ae32f0ba7e7768e8
              body: |
                In rare cases (believed to be caused by a non-atomic file creation and
                writing operation in containerd), we end up with an empty file at
                `/mnt/data/docker/containerd/daemon/io.containerd.grpc.v1.introspection/uuid`.
                This causes `ctr version` (and hence the health check) to fail. See
                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/322

                This commit addresses this issue in two ways:

                1. Before running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file exists and is
                   empty. If so, we remove it. (The subsequent execution of `ctr
                   version` by the healthcheck will create the file again.)
                2. After running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file was really
                   created and is not empty.

                In both cases, when an empty uuid file is detected, we log the event to
                help us confirm our hypothesis about the root cause.

                If the signing server's response is anything other than
                successful, such

                as with an authentication failure or bad request, the HTTP
                status code

                and response are hidden due to the --silent flag passed to cURL.


                Drop the stdio redirect to the output file along with the
                --silent flag,

                and instead use the -o parameter to output the response to the

                appropriate file on success. This allows the status code and
                response to

                be shown in the logs upon failure.

              body: >
                Main NetworkManager recipe was migrated to match latest one from

                meta-openembedded, so that all improvements are merged now.


                Excluded from it are `iwd` and `dhcpcd` daemon configurations
                that are

                not used by us.


                Default NM firewall in meta-openembedded is `nftables` where we
                are still

                using `iptables`.


                The new recipe relies on `meson` as a build system now.


                The .bbapend file that contains modifications specific to balena
                is preserved.

                Only `balena-client-id.patch` is removed as it references code
                that no longer

                exists. This is because the internal systemd DHCPv4 client code
                that NM used

                is now replaced by nettools' n-dhcp4 implementation.


                Closes #2872

                Current resolvconf version is broken for kirkstone, which is
                fixed upstream,

                so we reuse the fixed version from upstream.


                The symptom is that DNS servers provided by DHCP are not being
                used.

                When unlocking LUKS devices, udev events initializing the DM
                devices are still

                generated in the background even after cryptsetup luksOpen
                returns. We need to

                wait for the udev processing to finish before killing udev and
                cleaning up

                the udev database to avoid having to deal with partially
                initialized devices

                or corrupted udev database in the target OS.

                In the current state the cryptsetup initrd script tries to
                unlock all

                LUKS volumes in the system using the TPM. This includes
                user-defined LUKS

                volumes that, if present, fail to unlock and make the system
                unbootable.

                We should also not touch user-defined volumes in the first
                place.


                This patch modifies the cryptsetup script to only unlock LUKS
                volumes

                that are on the OS drive (same block device as the EFI
                partition).

                Partitions in flasher images are being created with different
                LABEL and

                PARTLABEL, for example:

                ```

                /dev/sdd2: LABEL="flash-rootA"
                UUID="5585296a-c183-4b10-89ae-20607e5604be" TYPE="ext4"
                PARTLABEL="resin-rootA"
                PARTUUID="582478f2-be4b-4279-9124-536385c9551d"

                ```


                This commit fixes the inconsistency as the PARTLABEL is used as
                a fallback

                method to identify devices.

                Enabling CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD=y improves the compression ratio
                compared

                to gzip while being faster to decompress. With kernel 5.15 in
                balenaOS

                v2.105, we see the 24 MB kernel compress to approximately 19 MB.


                Zstd support was added in commit 48f7ddf, first introduced in
                kernel

                v5.9. Enable this config unconditionally in supported kernels.


                Note that not every architecture and device support this option,
                but in

                those cases, Kconfig will automatically disable it as HAVE_ZSTD
                is also

                missing.

                        Hardcoding the bridge address like this results in
                        conflicts

                        when multiple instances are running on one jenkins node.


                        A new solution for local workstation testing will have
                        to be

                        considered.

                        Instead of retrying to get the DUT IP address 120 times on a 1 seconds interval,
                        let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will
                        timeout too in 15 seconds:

                        https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162

                        So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

        This issue occurred sporadically because gpio-poweroff
        was not always the last element in the overlays glob,
        and problem was caused by saving the incorrect list
        of overlays, which was missing the last element.

                Given that testbot devices use a tunnel to specific ports to
                communicate

                with the DUT that is established with the suite-generated keys,
                using

                a different keypair for the ssh-auth test would require to tear
                down and

                re-establish the tunnel.


                It's easier to just use the existing key pair in the ssh-auth
                test.

                authenticate by

                the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on
                testbot the

                key is used to establish the tunnel between core and DUT.


                Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and

                modifying the tests to use a single key.


                This reverts commit b24d92774a67cf0c0b83a29848bdcf6ed8a574db.

                There are two sets of keys used in this test, one stored in
                `/root/id`

                which is created by the cloud suite to SSH via the proxy server,
                and

                a custom key stored in `/root/test_id` used in some of the
                subtests.


                Fix the test cases using the custom key to use the correct
                private key.

                The `os-config` application stops the supervisor before fetching
                openvpn

                configuration and starting the `openvpn` service unit.


                As the `openvpn` service units stops `os-config`, it might not
                get to

                restart the supervisor.


                This commit checks that `os-config` is not already active before

                starting it.

                break

                the above.


                Also, add a test to check that the SSH authentication with user

                registered keys does not break again.

                Yocto builds will abort due to inconsistencies between the
                pseudo

                database and files modified outside of the pseudo context [0].


                This will occasionally cause builds to fail in the do_deploy
                step of the

                kernel-devsrc recipe. [1]


                Fix this by not removing the kernel_source tarball in the
                do_deploy

                step.

                This config file hasn't been used since commit 2db88c2, which
                unified

                how managed and unmanaged images operate. Since that commit,
                openvpn

                starts up if the config file at /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf is
                found, and

                otherwise remains inactive. This file is populated by os-config.


                Remove the old config to prevent misdirection and cleanup the
                layer.

                Chronyd checks that the directory specified as `sourcedir` in `chrony.conf`
                (in this case `/var/chrony`) is not world accessible if it exists (chrony
                will create it correctly if it does not exist), and does not start
                if that's the case.

                The way that the `/var/chrony` is created when it does not exist opens
                the possibility of the directory existing with the wrong permissions and
                hitting this problem.

                This commit creates the directory with the correct permissions from the
                start to avoid the race condition.

                It also changes the permissiong from 750 to 770 to match what chrony
                does (see
                https://github.com/mlichvar/chrony/blob/7b197953e8add5515b7e58c4638dc55aa4bb91b7/conf.c#L1761)

                        Unfortunately the standalone balena-cli package is
                        linked to glibc

                        and does not work with musl (alpine) so we need to
                        switch to debian.


                        The trade-off seems worth it for build times though.

                Instead of querying devices w/ `fdisk -l`, glob match patterns
                specified

                in resin-init-flasher.conf with devices present in `/dev`. This
                allows us to

                specify devices like `hd? sd? mmcblk?` instead of individual
                device

                numbers, which don't consistently map to any particular disk.


                This also allows RAID arrays to be matched with the array name
                and a

                pattern that glob matches even arrays assembled automatically on
                a

                non-matching host, such as `md/balena?(_?)` matching an array
                named

                `balena` and assembled on-device at `/dev/md/balena_0`.

                Recent versions of meta-balena include a balena-rust layer used
                to

                specify a distro-set Rust version across all supported Yocto
                versions


                As such, the syntax of this layer also needs to be converted.

                These packages also install kernel images into the boot
                directory in the

                root partition, overwriting the initramfs kernel installed by

                kernel-image-initramfs.


                Before kirkstone, the way to not include the kernel image was to

                override the `RDEPENDS:${KERNEL_PACKAGE_NAME}-base` not to
                include

                `kernel-image`, as was done in the `kernel-resin-noimage` class.


                Kirkstone changes the dependency from RDEPENDS to RRECOMMENDS in

                Poky's commit f6d963fa6d0e64d53f7ef56fd2c12d67f5811829


                Now excluding the kernel image needs to `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE =
                "kernel-image-*"`

                dependency and this package has not yet been split from

                thud.

                it was living in meta-rust.


                We want to use the balena-rust layer across a wide variety of
                Yocto

                versions so include the fetcher conditionally.

                The arch_to_rust_arch() function was introduced to cater for
                ppc64le

                systems and is not present in older Yocto releases.


                This commit reverts to the previous way of setting the rust
                architecture.

                It will not work for ppc64le and if we would need to support
                such an

                architecture the arch_to_rust_arch() function will still be
                called if it

                exists in Kirkstone or newer Yocto versions.

                With Kirkstone and the support of openSSL 3.0 it's not possible

                a set of dependencies that work for all of our rust applications
                across

                the 1.32 to 1.62 toolchain versions that are supported across
                all the

                Yocto versions we keep compatibility with.


                This layer allows to set a preferred version as a distro setting
                that can

                be used across all Yocto versions.

            - subject: Use a lightweight Engine healthcheck
              hash: 7146e4614c2658d6f7d5384602eb8ad213e08759
              body: >
                Previously, our healthcheck verified if we were able to start a
                new

                container. This had two downsides:


                1. It was relatively heavyweight. In devices under heavy load,
                it would
                   sometimes take so long to run that the Engine was killed by the
                   watchdog.
                2. It wrote to the storage media. Creating a container involves
                writing
                   some data to persistent storage, therefore the healthcheck was
                   wearing the storage media.

                This new healthcheck simply pings both `balenad` and
                `containerd`, which

                is much faster than starting a new container and doesn't write
                to disk.

                The step of pinging `containerd` is important because we have
                seen at

                least one case in the past in which `balenad` was working but

                `containerd` wasn't.

                With `WatchdogSignal=SIGTERM` systemd will send a SIGTERM and
                give the

                Engine 90 seconds to gracefully shutdown before sending a
                SIGKILL. We

                had cases of Engine metadata on disk getting corrupted after the

                watchdog sent it a SIGKILL directly. This change shall minimize
                this

                issue.

                the code for both of these HUPs were duplicated. This commit
                factors

                this code out to a common function.

                This is a small improvement over our previous test: in addition

                checking that the volumes themselves are preserved over HUPs, we
                now

                check if the contents of these volumes is preserved.

                The boot partition is currently a FAT filesystem that does not
                support

                atomic writes. To prevent corruption, this commit introduces a
                fatrw

                application that needs to be used both when reading and writing
                files

                to the boot partition to provide safe accesses.

                        The executeCommand family of methods default to retrying
                        on failure. In

                        some cases, such as in the ssh-auth test in the cloud
                        test suite, we

                        expect failures to happen, and want them to be raised
                        immediately. Other

                        situations might demand adjusting the number of retries
                        and interval to

                        fit specific tests. Add a retryOptions object to these
                        methods to allow

                        for this behavior to be configured.

                This test was broken previously, and would fail with "All
                configured

                authentication methods failed" after a long delay caused by
                excessive

                This allows for specific devices to override the defaults, which
                is to

                store configuration units on volatile memory re-generating them
                every

                boot and avoiding storage media writes.


                Changing this to permanent storage trades boot times with media
                life

                expectancy.

                Currently `os-config-json` is also parsing `units-conf.json` at
                runtime.

                This is expensive to do for smaller devices, so this commit
                performs the

                processing at build time.


                For this, it also splits the configuration units processing in

                balena-config-vars into its own recipe to allow for task
                ordering.

                Executing balena-config-vars is quite taxing for smaller
                devices. For

                example a RaspberryPi Zero.


                This commit introduces a cached memory file with the
                configuration

                environment that is recreated when `config.json` changes and
                will be

                used if present.

                This commit replaces BOOT_MOUNTPOINT with BALENA_BOOT_MOUNTPOINT
                to

                remove the duplication.

                When accessing a test device as part of a fleet, a cloud API key
                is

                required in order to generate an SSH key and access the device
                through

                the VPN. However, when accessing a device locally, such as a
                QEMU

                instance running on the workstation itself, we have a direct
                path, and

                no VPN is necessary.


                Make the apiKey optional, and don't login when it's not
                specified. This

                allows direct connections to work without it.

                We may have cases when for some boards we do not want
                to have all these files blacklisted. See for example
                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-rockpi/commit/b5eadcfb3a296eea2554dc0cbdd16002d51c5169

                In conclusion, we rework how the blacklist is constructed
                so that users of meta-balena can alter this list as they see fit.

                This changes the condition in the unit file from checking
                whether

                /dev/disk/by-state/balena-efi exists to checking whether
                /mnt/boot/EFI

                is a symlink. The original approach has a race condition
                populating

                the by-state symlink - it is depending on udev and if the link
                is

                not present when the service is started (after the boot
                partition is mounted),

                the service fails and the EFI partition is never mounted.


                The new approach does the trick pretty well - /mnt/boot/EFI is a
                symlink

                if the EFI partition is split and a regular directory in case
                there is a single

                boot partition. That said the service is only started when
                necessary

                and the waiting for udev is implemented as a part of the mount
                script.

                Recent versions of GRUB default to use shim_lock when in secure
                boot mode.

                We do not use shim and do not build the shim_lock module into
                GRUB EFI binary

                therefore this needs to be disabled.

                Add a healthcheck that will check that the NTP sources are
                reachable

                and the system time does not skew.


                The healthcheck will command a burst sync if there is no
                selected

                reachable source, and will restart chronyd if the system clock
                skews.


                Fixes #2314

                test fails

                and the default interval of waitUntil causes an excessive wait.

                current and should not move 2022.1.1 to sunset.

                When tests execute quicker, a race condition can occur where
                config.json

                is edited to remove the dnsServers property, but
                /run/dnsmasq.servers is

                not changed yet. This causes the test to fail, as the file is
                not empty.

                    not ok 1 - We should have an empty /run/dnsmasq.servers file.

                Fix this by waiting until the InvocationID of dnsmasq.service
                changes.

                        The root cause of this issue was an integer overflow in
                        32-bit platforms

                        -- specifically, when explicitly converting `io.Reader`
                        offsets

                        (`int64`) to slice indices (`int`, which is only 32-bit
                        long on 32-bit

                        platforms).


                        We already had in place the checks supposed to ensure
                        slice bounds where

                        always within the expected bounds. So, in a way, this
                        commit just

                        re-organizes the code so that we perform safely this
                        required `int64` to

                        `int` type conversion.

                        valid png during

                        the write step. This could prevent the device from
                        provisioning if some

                        corruption happens at some point.

                        This commit updates all backends that write to /mnt/boot
                        to do it

                        through a new `lib/host-utils` module. Writes are now
                        done using write +

                        sync as rename is not an atomic operation in vfat.


                        The change also applies for writes through the
                        `/v1/host-config`

                        endpoint.


                        Finally this change includes some improvements on tests.

                        The status field does not indicate the current state of
                        the Engine on the device.

                        Rather, it only indicates whether the HTTP response
                        returned successfully or not.


                        To get the current state of the device, i.e. whether it
                        has applied target state or not,

                        use the `appState` field in the response.

                        The linked issue describes the Supervisor not cleaning
                        up locks it creates due

                        to crashing at just the wrong time. After internal
                        discussion we decided to

                        differentiate Supervisor-created lockfiles from
                        user-created lockfiles by using

                        the `nobody` UID (65534) for Supervisor-created
                        lockfiles.


                        As the existing NPM lockfile lib does not allow creating
                        lockfiles atomically

                        with different UIDs, we move to using the lockfile
                        binary, which is part of the

                        procmail package. To allow nonroot users to write to
                        lock directories, permissions

                        are changed to allow write access by nonroot users.

                        Migration `M00008` had a bug with the check for legacy
                        apps, which

                        resulted in devices that had at some point been updated
                        from a single

                        container supervisor to get the error


                        ```

                        Undefined binding(s) detected when compiling UPDATE.
                        Undefined column(s): [appUuid] query

                        ```


                        This adds a new migration with the fix to ensure broken
                        fix the

                        inconsistent database state.

                        receiving the new format of the target state from the

                This reverts 5047757 where we set the global DHCP timeout for
                ipv4 to

                infinity to mitigate problems with routers that do not respond
                to DHCP

                requests in time.


                This however causes issues on some routers, which after power
                cycle fail to

                renew leases after they are expired.


                The same ipv4.dhcp-timeout can be specified on per connection
                basis. Since

                the case with lease renewal due to router power cycle is a more
                common case,

                it is better to keep the global dhcp-timeout default unmodified.
                If the

                setting needs adjustment then it can be overwritten in the
                particular

                connection profile.

              hash: c4ce541526455c8cb891e7c76889e0d4cb2735b1
              body: >
                There are known situations in which balenaEngine times out
                during

                initialization (for example, during aufs to overlayfs
                migrations, or

                when restarting a device that was running a large number of
                containers).

                When these time outs occur, Systemd kills the Engine, causing
                further

                problems.


                To avoid these cases, this commit disables timeouts during the
                Engine

                initialization.


                This is also aligned with the default Systemd settings
                distributed with

                the Moby project.

                        This adds two new integration tests:


                        * TestDeltaSize: this is meant to catch regressions on
                        delta sizes. It
                          generates deltas and compare their sizes with the delta sizes we get
                          as of now. If the size increases, the test fails.
                        * TestDeltaCorrectness: checks if applying a delta
                        indeed results in the
                          same image as we had originally.

                        A number of different test cases (different images with
                        distinct

                        features) are tested for each of these integration
                        tests.

                Also, let's make sure an error is thrown when the hostapp cannot
                be made public.

                Let's ensure tools like fixdep are built in container
                and not reused from the yocto build, otherwise they
                may not run if they were linked against a different
                version of libc that may not be available in the kernel
                modules build container.

                This fixes the following error encountered when doing
                a Poky Honister build for the balena-intel repository:

                  scripts/basic/fixdep: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34'

              body: >
                This was originally introduced in combination with a kernel
                patch backported

                from Red Hat kernel that would enable kernel lockdown when
                secure boot

                is enabled. We have since changed the approach, dropped the
                kernel patch

                and when in secure boot mode use a different GRUB config file
                that enables

                lockdown on kernel command line unconditionally.


                That said, while the patch works fine, we do not really need it
                and it adds

                extra overhead porting it to newer yocto versions so there is no
                point keeping

                it at this moment. If in the future there is need for the kernel
                to know

                whether it is in secure boot mode or not, we can roll this back
                and rebase.

                In most cases there is not enough space on rootfs to extract

                and load a local hostapp image when the balena-host tmpdir

                is on the same partition.


                This uses a data mount to ensure temporary extracted files of
                the

                compressed image will not fill the target sysroot.

                endpoint,

                The issue that this test is aimed at has been introduced in

                kernel versions above 4.13. On older kernels like for instance

                4.9, the test will not pass.


                Let's run this test on kernel versions where the issue was
                present.

                Since https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commit/1eee36a5520b5a89fb4d0d6af6f9cb0217a3164f
                was merged and included in kernel versions after 5.10.84,
                building the kernel-modules-headers fails due to various missing
                headers from the gmp and mpc packages. This problem is visible
                only after upgrading to a newer kernel, because until now the
                gcc plugins kernel config was not enabled at all, due to the
                failed check in the above mentioned patch.

                Since we are not using the functions provided
                by the gcc plugins anyway, we can disable this
                config.

                In the current state the by-state symlink for balena-efi
                partition

                is not generated for two reasons:

                - 60-resin-update-state.rules only react to resin-* partition
                names

                - the root device is not identified correctly in
                resin_update_state_probe
                  for LUKS devices

                This patch fixes both the issues and makes use of the by-state
                symlink

                instead of by-label.

                This patch adds the check for PCRs

                - 0 - firmware/UEFI blob

                - 1 - firmware/UEFI config

                - 2 - Expansion card firmware blobs

                - 3 - Expansion card firmware configs


                The full protection is only applied on first boot after
                provisioning,

                flasher only locks against PCRs 0, 2 and 3.

                This is because when using flasher, the environment is not in
                the same

                state as the one we want to lock to. In particular the boot
                order is

                different (flasher is booted from a different drive than the
                resulting OS).

                As for now we were not able to find a better solution than fully
                locking

                only on first boot. This means the device must be booted in a
                secure

                environment at least once after provisioning.

      body: |
        The Pi3 32bit currently refuses to boot if
        gpu_mem is set to 396MB. This seems to be caused
        by a variable we use in u-boot to avoid locking
        while writing to the uart, if enable_uart is
        disabled in config.txt.

        Having the putc_retry variable uninitialized
        meant that it was part of the data section,
        however this no longer seems to be the case and
        we need to allocate it in .data explicitly.

                        The moby engine v20.x.y adds some selinux [security configurations](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration)
                        depending on the [container configuration](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/daemon/create.go#L214).
                        This would cause the supervisor to enter a service restart loop as the
                        current and target service configurations will never match. The
                        supervisor now ignores selinux specific security options since those are
                        not supported by balenaOS.

                        This brings all migration logic into a single call into
                        the

                        storagemigration package, which should make future
                        maintenance easier

                        and fixes the cleanup logic bug, where the old aufs root
                        would never be

                        cleaned up.

                        This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads
                        after failures with

                        the goal of making it more resilient, especially for
                        cases involving

                        large layers and unreliable network connections.


                        These are the changes:


                        * Make sure we also retry after failures in
                        `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                          This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                          and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                        * Wait exponentially longer times between retries
                        (instead of retrying
                          immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                          network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                        * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                        * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download
                        anything at all.
                          The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                          continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                          strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                          will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                        * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                        a lot of devices have unreferenced graphdriver layers on
                        disk.


                        With this change, the engine will be able to clean up
                        such unreferenced layers.

                        by the graph driver without any link to the layers

                The prepare-openvpn service needs to be restarted to regenerate
                the

                VPN keys when provisioning is finished and the `apiKey` is
                removed.


                Note that flasher images make changes to
                `/mnt/boottmp/config.json` so

                we still need to manually kick `prepare-openvpn` in

                `resin-device-register`, which is preferable to modifying
                services to

                watch multiple paths.

                Avoid additional wait and API call when we already have the
                device ID.


                This might also resolve a race condition that has been difficult
                to

                track down.

                Upstream kernel added a new fkms overlay for
                the Pi4 and CM4 and switched to using it
                from overlay-map, however, we were not aware
                of this.

                Let's add a vcdbg testcase to warn in case the RPi
                firmware fails to load any overlay or dtb, and set
                gpu_mem to 64 so that vcdbg can run.

              hash: 13cf7c9fef0a6e0df6b042ba34ceaa7a0d005254
              body: >
                We want the VPN to start unconditionally even if the
                connectivity URL

                is not reachable.


                The rationale for adding the dependency in the first place was
                that

                without an initial timesync certificate checks may fail. This
                can still

                happen, but the VPN will retry continuously and eventually
                succeed once

                the time is synched.


                What happens now is that the VPN is delayed until the http sync,
                so if

                the connectivity URL is blocked or unreachable, but the internet
                is

                accessible, VPN will not even launch and no remote debugging is
                possible.


                Fixes #2508

                on config.json changes are part of this target.


                This causes a burst of service restarts each time config.json
                changes,

                independently of whether the configuration changes applies to

                preparation for

                the introduction of a better, more fine grained mechanism.

                emulate that

                by copying flasher kernel to the EFI partition, start it from
                GRUB, have it

                unlock all the partitions, find the real kernel and kexec into
                it.

                this case, since there may be devices that
                continue to work even if under-powered and we
                don't want to block or delay development if the
                DUT is remote and cannot be checked or replaced
                easily.

                This check provides an indication for further
                debugging of failed test cases.

                When resizing the filesystem fails, such as when resize2fs won't
                touch

                it because it's dirty, the partition gets resized, but not the

                filesystem. The script will not attempt to resize the filesystem
                again,

                as it detects the partition has already been resized.


                Split these actions apart, so that the filesystem resize is
                always

                attempted. If resize2fs detects that the filesystem is already
                filling

                available space, it will exit with no action taken.

                Let's only apply this code to pre-warrior as intended. Starting
                with warrior this code is in poky so we can rely on it from
                there instead of keeping a duplicate in meta-balena-common.
                This helps with BSPs that may define their own tasks (configure,
                compile and so on) for u-boot (keeping this fragments merging
                code in meta-balena-common would have the effect of overwriting
                these tasks from here and thus breaking the build).

                jq is used in the bootfiles hostapp-update
                hook for accessing config.json, which may have
                one of the modification dates invalid,
                as we've seen during testing. We thus need to
                avoid performing a touch on config.json
                to avoid reloading of containers.

                For example, when we branch an ESR release, the meta-balena
                branch is

                tagged with the ESR name, like 2.83.x, while the last
                meta-balena version

                will be a proper semver.

                The chrony driftfile is not being updated at shutdown due to an

                incorrect mount service dependency in the systemd
                chronyd.service

                file. The current dependency on 'var-volatile-lib' does not
                cover the

                subsequent bind mounting of the '/var/lib/chrony' sub-directory,
                so

                the chrony directory gets unmounted at shutdown before the drift
                file

                has been updated.


                This issue is solved by changing the mount service dependency
                from

                'var-volatile-lib' to 'bind-var-lib-chrony' (which is similar to
                the

                way bind mount dependencies are already handled for the
                NetworkManager

                and bluetooth services).

                Poky releases older than Honister should stick to rust v1.36
                which has been used in balenaOS builds so far.

                Newer ones should prefer v1.54, which is the latest rust
                version to use the Honister syntax.

                As resin-rootA is used to decide whether to re-run the
                generation, leave it

                last. As it stands, if resin-rootA is regenerated by any other

                On transitioning from the initramfs to the rootfs, the udev
                database is

                cleanedup as the rules between initramfs and rootfs might defer.


                However, dm devices are flagged not to be re-processed, so we
                need to

                set a sticky bit on them so they persist the cleanup.

                This is needed because the rules in the final rootfs might be

                different than the one in the initramfs.


                Devices that need to persist, like dm devices, need to be
                flagged with

                the `db_persist` option.

                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run
                directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run
                is not

                there.


                Commit bab3cd7f50022127bfef50fde9cd445b6b55a7b2 switches to use
                /tmp

                to store the new UUID for the root partition on first boot after

                generating new UUIDs as this is backwards compatible.


                However, this means that the udev database in the initramfs is
                recreated

                on the final system instead of reused. This becomes a problems
                for DM

                devices (used in luks based disk encryption), as they are not
                re-processed

                by udevd.


                This change will use /run if available, so new releases that may
                implement

                disk encryption work, or /tmp if not so it still remains
                backwards

                compatible for HUP from older releases.

                Some BSPs name the u-boot such as u-boot-imx_2020 for example.
                Because of that, our existing bbappend called u-boot_%.bbappend
                will not match it and will fail to be applied.
                This PR is a first pass at solving this by moving at least the
                SRC_URI appending part from this bbappend and into the
                resin-u-boot.bbclass instead. Further investigation is needed
                to see if we can remove this bbappend altogether since we may
                have all boards using Poky Warrior or newer, making this
                u-boot bbappend obsolete.

                unprogrammed value AA:AA:AA...:AA.

                We've addressed this in the device repo,
                meanwhile it has been fixed in upstream
                too, so let's check and catch this should
                it happen again.

                This patch replaces the kernel being shipped with the one that
                we eventually

                sign for EFI - without signing the original file used would be
                identical

                but after applying signature, the signed version is the one we
                want to ship.


                It also fixes the file name for the detached signature, which
                must match

                the name of the associated file.

              hash: 2bb18707557979ed6466f45602de4ecf5b386c57
              body: >
                Add a new timesync-https systemd service to synchronise the
                system

                time at boot using an HTTPS header. The service uses curl to
                request

                an HTTPS header from either $API_ENDPOINT/connectivity-check
                (default)

                or the URL defined by the os.network.connectivity.uri field in

                config.json. The URL used *must* return HTTP code 204 (No
                Content)

                in response to a request so that we can determine that we have
                full

                network connectivity and are not operating behind a captive
                portal.


                The date field returned by a valid header is used to set the
                current

                system time. The date/time derived from the header is assumed to
                be a

                reasonable source of 'truth' such that it can be used to adjust
                the

                system time both backwards and forwards. This will compensate
                for any

                erroneous timestamps saved via fake-hwclock or any invalid data

                read from an RTC.


                The service will exit when a valid response has been received.
                Poll

                attempts will be made at an increasing interval starting at 2s
                and

                doubling up to a maximum of 64s. Polling will continue at the
                maximum

                interval until a valid response has been received.


                This service will provide initial time synchronisation for
                devices

                where NTP ports have been blocked. For devices where NTP access
                is

                available it should ensure that any system 'time jump' is only a
                few

                seconds when NTP synchronisation is eventually achieved. It also

                allows other services to start with a reasonably accurate time

                without having to wait for the NTP synchronisation process to

                complete.


                Services that are ordered after the new time-sync-https-wait
                target

                can be sure that full network connectivity has been achieved and
                that

                time has been synchronised with an accuracy of a few seconds.

                When udev runs resin_update_state_probe for a non-balena
                partition

                and ENV{ID_PART_ENTRY_NAME} is undefined it still gets expanded
                to random

                garbage accidentally lying at the eventual memory address. This
                can create

                a mess in /dev/disk/by-state e.g. when external devices are
                connected.

                The interface test uses a simple ping to ensure a specific
                interface

                works. It sends ten packets, and expects ten packets back.
                However, the

                default interval is one second, which increases the time taken
                for the

                test while not adding anything of value.


                Reduce the timeout to the minimum non-privileged interval of
                2ms.

                The hook tries to read EFI variables from efivarfs but this is
                not always

                mounted within the container. We have already validated that we
                are running

                in EFI mode therefore we can just check whether it is already
                mounted

                and eventually mount with no further checks.


                This also adds graceful handling of nonexistent variables since
                not all

                UEFI implementations come with secure boot support.

                At this moment GRUB drops to rescue shell if config is invalid

                or if signatures are missing/wrong. This lets the user disable
                the signature

                checks altogether.


                With this patch GRUB outputs nothing and accepts no user input
                if signing

                is configured.

                it is a hacky

                approach and we will look for a clean solution.

                GRUB can not use the TPM easily to unlock the volumes and find
                the kernel

                on an encrypted partition. Instead, we choose to store a linux
                kernel

                and use it as 2nd stage bootloader to unlock the partition, load
                the actual

                kernel and kexec into it. This should eventually be replaced by
                a proper

                2nd stage bootloader that is being worked on.

                Currently the two classes would keep the original files
                untouched and store

                the signed versions as .signed. This patch reverses the logic -
                the signed

                files replace the original ones and the unsigned version is
                stored as .unsigned.

                This is because there is no real use-case for the unsigned
                files, we always

                want to ship the signed version, even if the particular DT does
                not require it,

                this causes no harm.

                When a device is running in secure boot mode, it must not be
                possible to HUP

                to an unsigned version of the OS because UEFI would refuse to
                boot it before

                any of our self-recovering rollback mechanisms can be triggered.
                This would

                effectively brick the device, needing physical access to
                recover.

              hash: 07dbe414a1dfa556427d4fc94ce7fdec688cf0e2

                Previously, the core service exposed a /proxy endpoint that
                would start

                up a proxy remotely, which would be used by a test in the
                connectivity

                module. However, the endpoint returned the address for the
                testbot to be

                used as the proxy in the response, and this required manual

                configuration of the interface. Additionally, it requires the
                worker

                service to install and provide glider for forward proxying.


                Move the proxy (glider) to a container on the device being
                tested,

                which simplifies configuration, and reduces the complexity and
                size of

                the interface of Leviathan.

                This patch was submitted and accepted upstream, and is present since

                This fixes a build error applying a patch that's already been applied
                when building newer versions of dosfstools.

                Add a test to wait for the chronyd service to become active
                before

                starting the time sync tests.


                The current chronyd tests assume that the chronyd service is

                instantly available at boot time. With the addition of the new

                HTTPS time synchronisation service the starting of chronyd can
                be

                delayed by a few seconds so we need to ensure that the service

                is actually running before proceeding.

                        previously switch would treat S_IFIFO and S_IFSOCK as
                        the same, passing

                        both of the to mkfifo, which lead to EINVAL errors when
                        trying to create

                        the socket, we instead handle socket separately.

                The Rock Pi 4B uses a file named hw_intf.conf for
                enabling/disabling interfaces and for loading overlays.
                Just noting that the syntax is also slightly different
                from the config.txt file on RaspberryPi.

                Let's blacklist this file to avoid overriding
                it during an OS update.

              body: |
                When user namespacing was enabled in the kernel by default, a separate
                commit [0] was introduced to disable the feature at runtime, to allow
                users/administrators to explicitly choose to enable it, avoiding
                potential security implications.

                However, some applications such as Chromium's sandbox, require either
                SUID or user namespacing to work. Disabling this feature on boards
                that previously enabled it necessitates container modifications and
                potentially breaks previously working applications.

                Create a distro feature to disable user namespacing by default in
                meta-balena, while allowing device types to keep it enabled to maintain
                compatibility with their original behavior.

                The previous commit moved the preloaded image out of yocto
                cache, which

                made it unreachable from the balena-generate-ami-env container.


                This patch makes mktemp create the file back within yocto cache
                to ensure

                this is shared yet still each concurrent process can safely have
                its own copy.

                Since the file name is hardcoded at this moment, this fails when
                two

                builds are running in parallel (e.g. dev and prod variants
                during deploy)

                because they try to preload the same file at pretty much the
                same moment.

                Having a separate copy for each outside of yocto cache should
                fix the issue.

        The changes from this patch are now upstreamed in other form
        so let's remove this obsolete backport from our layer.

        With this patch being applied, the USB 2.0 ports on a Raspberry Pi 4
        v1.4 (the 8GB RAM version for example) - which lacks SPI flash for the
        VIA VL805 chip - do not function.

                At runtime we can now enable development features that were
                previously

                configured using the development-image feature. That feature
                also

                configured U-Boot for OS development.


                Now we have two distinct functionalities:


                * A runtime development configuration variable that configures
                the

                device to facilitate application development

                * A build time osdev-image feature that configures the OS for
                BSP and OS

                development


                This allows us to merge the current production/development
                images into

                a single image.

                other OS development like board bringup.

                the new OS anymore. This is necessary only when updating from
                older

                OS versions in which the supervisor adds the isolcpus

                setting to the boot partition extlinux.conf file.

                        PR #1749 introduced a bug when pushing local target state. An update to
                        the [image name normalization](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19/src/lib/docker-utils.ts#L81)
                        failed to consider the local image name format. This results in mangling
                        of image names in the database, i.e. the image `ubuntu:latest` is stored
                        as `/ubuntu:latest`. This causes an exception to be returned by the
                        dockerode `getImage('/ubuntu:latest').inspect()` call.

                        This sends the supervisor into a crash loop and is shown on the supervisor
                        journal logs as

                        ```
                        getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND images
                            at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:64:26)
                        ```

                        Unfortunately if this happens on a user device, since the mangled image
                        name is already on the database, the easiest way to fix is to remove the
                        supervisor database and let the supervisor recreate it. Deleting the
                        database should be side effect free.

                        Preparing for the new v3 target state, where the
                        supervisor will make environment

                        dependent ids optional and rely on using general UUIDs
                        and user known identifiers

                        for comparison. This PR moves forward in that direction
                        by removing some of those

                        comparisons for v2 target state.

                        This is a backwards compatible change, meaning it
                        doesn't completely get rid of

                        these identifiers (which are still being used by
                        supervisor API and for state

                      hash: f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19

                        The image manager module now uses tags instead of docker
                        IDs as the main

                        way to identify docker images on the engine. That is, if
                        the target

                        state image has a name `imageName:tag@digest`, the
                        supervisor will always use

                        the given `imageName` and `tag` (which may be empty) to
                        tag the image on

                        the engine after fetching. This PR also adds checkups to
                        ensure

                        consistency is maintained between the database and the
                        engine.


                        Using tags allows to simplify query and removal
                        operations, since now

                        removing the image now means removing tags matching the
                        image name.


                        Before this change the supervisor relied only on
                        information in the

                        supervisor database, and used that to remove images by
                        docker ID. However, the docker

                        id is not a reliable identifier, since images retain the
                        same id between

                        releases or between services in the same release.

                        The previous module was using `rewire` to get the knex
                        instance from the

                        db module but that was leading to issues when running
                        tests using `test:fast`.

                        This provides a fix for the test module that just
                        removes the destroy

                        call entirely (it turns out it is not necessary).

                This commit adds a FIRMWARE_COMPRESSION distro configuration
                that

                performs the compression of linux-firmware files. Only kernel
                versions

                above 5.3 support loading compressed firmware.

                This allows to re-use this functionality. Note that the
                `KERNEL_VERSION`

                variable is only available after the kernel has been built as it
                relies

                source.

                Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any

                network interface. It makes more sense to run it for

                'connectivity-change' events as we are really interested in
                whether

                the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is

                up or down.

                Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing
                enabled

                in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and
                Ubuntu,

                default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user

                namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in
                the

                kernel.


                Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more
                conservative,

                disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian

                maintains its own patch to add the
                kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone

                tunable.


                The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of
                application

                developers not using this feature due to it being generally
                unavailable

                in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.


                RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max
                number of

                user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but
                without

                an out of tree patch.


                Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as
                RHEL, in

                the same manner as the hardened kernels and distributions have
                chosen.

                We can now use a runtime drop-in unit placed under /run/systemd/
                to

                configure the balena-host service, which doesn't require us to
                remount

                the rootfs.

                Update balena-engine from 19.03.18 to 19.03.23


                Which brings more resilient layer download (allows proper
                resuming after

                network failures).

                    - subject: Make layer download resuming more resilient

                        This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads
                        after failures with

                        the goal of making it more resilient, especially for
                        cases involving

                        large layers and unreliable network connections.


                        These are the changes:


                        * Make sure we also retry after failures in
                        `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                          This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                          and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                        * Wait exponentially longer times between retries
                        (instead of retrying
                          immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                          network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                        * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                        * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download
                        anything at all.
                          The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                          continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                          strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                          will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                        * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                        During fingerpinting of the source image the destination
                        layers are not

                        exepmt from being released (e.g. when `balena image rm

                        simultaneously.

                        Similarly when processing the destination layers to
                        generate deltas we

                        only hold one reference at a time, leaving the
                        subsequent layers

                        vulnerable to the same issues.

                This target service can be used to restart other services
                that have explicitly set themselves as PartOf this target.

                So a service that should be restarted when config.json changes
                can use PartOf=config-json.target to be triggered automatically.

                Resolve `latest` to dev variant


                If we want the serial logs of the DUT the image that is flashed
                needs to

                be the development variant. The `latest` shortcut however always

                resolves to the production image. We manually resolve the
                version to fix

                this.

                Currently it is possible to build a docker image that will then
                fail to

                hup due to a lack of space on the inactive partition.


                Add a task to check the docker image space against the available
                space on

                the root filesystem partition and fail the build if it's too
                big.

                Replace the IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE magic number with a calculation
                based on

                the partition sizes on the balena image classes.


                The rootfs size is calculated with the assumption of a total
                BalenaOS

                size of 700M. This includes boot, state, rootA and rootB
                partitions. The

                data partition will then grow to occupy the rest of the storage
                media.


                Device integration layers can override this value if needed.

              body: >
                Add a new systemd service to check for full network
                connectivity.

                This service is required because the default NetworkManager (NM)

                connectivity checker doesn't differentiate between the

                CONNECTED_LOCAL, CONNECTED_SITE and CONNECTED_GLOBAL states.
                This

                service checks for the CONNECTED_GLOBAL state only and can be
                used

                to delay the start of other services which require full network

                access to be available. This can help to avoid startup problems
                on

                networks with slow DNS access or that utilise a captive portal.


                The script does an initial oneshot check of the NM state to make
                sure

                that we don't wait for an event that doesn't come. This check is

                redundant at boot time due to the fact that the service is
                started

                before NM to ensure that no NM DBus events are missed. The
                initial

                check is useful in circumstances where you want to run the
                script

                standalone or post-boot.


                Other services that wish to make use of this service and wait
                for

                full network connectivity should add the following entries to
                their

                systemd unit definition:


                Requires=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target

                After=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target

                This makes it easier to overwrite the arguments passed in the engine
                unit from drop-in overwrites. See the development image drop-in unit for
                reference.

                Using `systemctl edit --runtime balena.service`, which puts those
                overwrites into `/run/systemd/system/balena.service.d/`, it would be
                possible to modify the runtime behavior of the engine without remounting
                the rootfs to be writeable.

                See https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#System%20Unit%20Search%20Path

        We are using kernel 5.4 now so let's remove the older 4.19 recipe.

                Currently we are reading a package list from the contracts that
                mixes

                recipe and package names, and we run bitbake with the `-k` flag
                not to

                stop the build when a package name fails to match a recipe.


                The contracts have now been modified to specify either a
                `sw.recipe.yocto`

                or a `sw.package.yocto` so we can distinguish between them and
                use

                recipe names to build and package names to install.


                We also remove the continue flag from bitbake.

                containers on the default bridge network cannot communite with
                the

                outside as no iptables rules are set.

                This is

                too long for the creation of per-task balena-engine sockets
                which have

                a maximum path length of 104 characters.

                This commit replaces the installation directory with "/work".

              hash: d965d23fe60db6254eaabd81a0d48b5718e01a3a
              body: >
                The hostapp-update hooks would run before the supervisor update
                step

                when using balenahup via the dashboard. This resulted in the
                balena

                supervisor state conf file being out-of-date.


                This commit removes the hostapp-update hook and instead uses a

                oneshot service to ensure the conf is migrated if it does not
                exist

                in the new path before starting the supervisor.

                This commit brings the bluez5 recipe from poky master as we need
                to control which bluez5 version is used in meta-balena.

                The code originates from poky's master branch -

                Some BSPs have enabled CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC which

                can trigger panics upon high iowait, such as balena-engine

                downloading/writing a large image to disk.


                Kconfig says the following:

                    Say Y here to enable the kernel to panic on "hung tasks",
                    which are bugs that cause the kernel to leave a task stuck
                    in uninterruptible "D" state.

                    The panic can be used in combination with panic_timeout,
                    to cause the system to reboot automatically after a
                    hung task has been detected. This feature is useful for
                    high-availability systems that have uptime guarantees and
                    where a hung tasks must be resolved ASAP.

                    Say N if unsure.

                Hung tasks are not normally terminal, nor do they affect system

                stability, but panicking during an image write forces a device
                into a

                bootloop that requires manual intervention to remedy.


                See the below stacktrace:

                balena-engine hasn't transitioned to building with modules yet,
                and Go

                1.16 enabled them by default. Revert to the old behavior for now
                to fix
                  the build.

                This option will be removed in Go 1.17, so we'll have to update
                our

                build before upgrading further.

                Improve the handling of the os.network.* parameters defined in

                config.json.


                The balena-config-vars script has been updated to process the

                os.network.* parameters from config.json. This allows scripts

                to access these parameters by just including balena-config-vars

                rather than having to parse them directly. Some of the default

                settings have now been included as part of the jq parsing
                string.

                The jq command has also been assigned to an interim variable
                rather

                than being evaluated directly. This allows other scripts which

                include balena-config-vars to handle parsing errors correctly
                when

                they are running with 'set -e'.


                The os-networkmanager script has been updated to make use of the

                balena-config-vars script and no longer parses config.json
                itself.

                The logging has been standardised and the simplification of the

                variable processing has reduced the size of the script from 146

                to 101 lines.


                The build time tests have been removed as the os-networkmanager
                script

                is unable to access /usr/sbin/balena-config-vars at buildtime.

                    - subject: Show warning instead of exception for invalid network config
                      hash: 5197a1330d69cbff97f3c53a77f640638e074b8a
                      body: >
                        A previous PR (#1656) fixed validation for network ipam
                        config,

                        checking that both network and subnet are defined for
                        each ipam config entry

                        (as described in the docker documentation).


                        After that PR, the validations throws an exception if
                        the network target state is incorrect,

                        but this turns out to be the wrong approach, because
                        that exception is also triggered

                        when querying target state.


                        This isn't a problem in normal operation, but it is in
                        local mode, because local

                        mode queries the old target state before sending a new
                        one. Since the query fails,

                        the CLI can never push the new target state.


                        This PR replaces the exception with a warning on the
                        logs, since a

                        misconfigured network won't cause any engine failures,
                        it will just

                        prevent containers to communicate through the provided
                        network.


                        A future improvement should move this validation to an
                        earlier point in the process,

                        so the target state can get rejected before it even gets
                        to a point it

                        can be used.

                        The `start-resin-supervisor` script in newer OS version
                        no longer uses the

                        SUPERVISOR_TAG environment variable setup on
                        supervisor.conf and

                        update-supervisor.conf.


                        This change removes the need for that variable with
                        livepush supervisor

                        to make it compatible with older and newer OS versions

                        'mz' can be safely replaced with fs.promises
                        and util.promisify for faster native methods.
                        'mkdirp' after Node v8 uses native fs.mkdir, thus
                        is redundant. 'body-parser' is deprecated and
                        contained within express v4.x.

                In order to verify GPG signature of grub.cfg it must be
                immutable.

                All the variables should be stored in grubenv file. This means

                bootcount, resin_root_part and upgrade_available variables need

                to be moved to grubenv.

                This is needed in preparation for storage migration from aufs to
                overlayfs.

                When running hostapp-update, we need to create the target
                hostapp on

                overlayfs, which implies the OS we update from can support both
                drivers

                This brings in the aufs-to-overlay migrator. Which won't run

                `BALENA_MIGRATE_OVERLAY=1`

                env var.


                The other notable change is the fix for

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/236 which

                We need to make sure the modem is completely initialized before
                sending

                the AT commands that do the switch to ECM mode. To achieve this
                we

                change the systemd service dependency to depend on
                ModemManager.service

                and then we determine the modem state by using mmcli and
                querying the

                modem power-state property.


                This procedure will only be done once. After the modem is placed
                in ECM

                mode, it will stay in this mode for future reboots so there will
                be no

                other delays in bringing up the modem connection.

        second, it further clears up the fact that this machine is solely

              hash: 2b07011844a2738aec033d88af29e3f6e0dd28a2

                Added a dependency on resin-state.service and
                resin-state-reset.service

                to etc-fake-hwclock.mount.


                On initial boot after flashing a device the
                resin-state-reset.service

                was running after etc-fake-hwclock.mount causing the bind mount
                point

                /mnt/state/root-overlay/etc/fake-hwclock to be deleted after it
                had

                been mounted. This resulted in a failure to save the date/time
                at

                shutdown which caused problems with persistent logging at next
                boot.

                Subsequent boots are unaffected as resin-state-reset does not
                run.

                Adding a dependency on the resin-state services ensures that the

                bind mount point is created after the state reset has been
                performed.


                This issue was noticed when running the testbot unmanaged OS
                image

                persistent logging test. When running a managed OS image the
                device

                normally reboots fairly immediately after connecting to the

                balena-cloud host and receiving parameter updates, so this issue
                is

                not usually noticeable.

                At this moment resin_update_state_probe is scanning pretty much
                every

                block device for rootfs. This include ramdisks, zram and loop
                devices

                which, when scanned, even spam warnings in logs. This patch
                updates

                the udev rule to skip such devices and only trigger on add or
                change

                events.

              hash: 7983e9bfd716aaedad1ef5f1468b2771e1f5a71c
              body: >
                Previously we were loading the healthcheck image from it's own
                service

                that was previously made `PartOf=` the balena.service.

                This was done in an attempt to help get the system unstuck when
                the

                image is removed (like through manual pruning), which would
                cause the

                healthcheck to trigger the engine to reboot until the load
                service was

                restarted by hand.


                Further investigation found a race between the first execution
                of the

                engine healthcheck script (which needs the image to be loaded)
                and the

                loader service itself, which would lead to a similar state,
                requireing

                manual intervention.


                This change moves the loading into the healthcheck script
                itself,

                allowing us to remove the loader script and service entirely,
                skipping

                the whole service ordering issue.

              hash: 5e1004d6753025166c40b11af117e008feb875f1
              body: >
                grub-efi requires modules to be installed in the boot partition,
                and

                resin-image installs them from ${DEPLOYDIR}.


                A normal grub installation installs those modules to
                ${PREFIX}/${libdir}

                to allow grub tooling to install them at runtime, but we're
                building the

                image with GRUB baked in, so we don't need those in the sysroot.


                The first iteration of this bbappend attempted to solve these

                constraints by copying the modules from ${D}/${libdir}/grub/ to

                ${DEPLOYDIR} in do_deploy(), then removing ${D}${prefix}. This
                had the

                unfortunate side effect of breaking the build in certain cases,
                such as

                clean builds or reexecuting do_deploy() without the other steps
                of the

                build.


                Instead, remove the unwanted files in do_install(), and append
                the

                required modules to GRUB_BUILDIN to create a standalone grub
                image

                without any external modules at all.

                as UUID=xxx the waiting loop in rootfs initrd script would
                assume UUIDs have

                just been regenerated and wait for a by-state symlink instead.
                This only works

                for the OS - flasher does not use the dynamically generated
                UUIDs

                therefore we always want to use the by-uuid link for it.

        The pl01 serial issue has only been reported
        for the Pi4 based boards, which use the current
        u-boot github master HEAD revision, to include
        cm4 and pi400 fixes. Include this patch only
        for Pi4 for now as it won't apply on the
        default u-boot from poky.

        The 000x patches, init and run-ptest come from poky
        bluez 5.55, the other two are backported from github
        bluez issue 101. We update to Bluez 5.56 to apply these
        two pending patches and check if they solve an issue
        that affects this board's use-case.

                Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount

                unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).


                Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock
                directory

                results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the
                same

                directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods
                try to

                unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory
                being

                unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save
                the

                system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time

                at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

                once at boot. Previously the script was being run up to 8 times
                at

                Fixes #2075


                Needed were a number of various changes to make the package
                compile properly:


                Removed is
                0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch that
                is now

                included upstream.


                Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is
                reworked for ease of

                maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to
                debug level.


                Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a
                wrong version number.


                The following additional configuration options were
                added/removed:


                *. Introspection is disabled through
                `--enable-introspection=no`. Other services do

                not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is
                no longer needed

                0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


                *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is
                disabled as we do not

                use firewalld.


                *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so
                `--enable-polkit-agent` and

                `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

              hash: 00556af37cf241e2b95d9b719f1ab58cc9bbddb6
              body: |
                Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing
                any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat
                from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.

                By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args
                such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of this
                when compiled in "desktop" mode.

                This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary into
                a separate procps package:

                - https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=507a47a4e5077d5f8f76d9629be6b871dfd8eb90

                So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into compat branches
                and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than gatesgarth.

        u-boot 2020.x switched to using the pl_01x driver which
        locks up too if the uart is incorrecty configured
        or is disabled from config.txt. We add a retry count
        to avoid locking forever when serial isn't available.

              hash: e86c83e9be007bbedf5bad8bb961931c4f4f649c
              body: >
                Fixes #1846


                UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under

                balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to
                establish

                ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.


                This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to
                `/etc/ppp/options`

                to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.


                The connect option specifies an external script to establish the

                physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is

                ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing
                it

                to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

                This is necessary because node has its own built-in CA bundle
                and ignores

                the system-wide bundle. Bind-mount the system-wide bundle to the
                supervisor

                container as well to keep the previous behavior. Make it
                read-only though,

                any modifications should be performed by the host OS.

                Initially I hoped thud and warrior could also use the respective
                upstreams but I see several differences between the meta-balena
                version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
                as well.

                - the ability to add server pools via scripts using chronyc.
                - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
                  as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
                - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.
                - repeat 'iburst' when a source is changed from offline to
                  online state.

                commit is no longer needed.

                the supervisor database was relocated by mistake. On this version the database
                returns to its original place, and these hooks copy the old database to the
                new location to avoid data loss.

                Ensure that the /var/log/supervisor-log directory exists prior
                to

                running 'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' as well as

                'runSupervisor'.


                Updates to the 'start-resin-supervisor' script in v2.62.1
                removed

                the check for updates to the REGISTRY_ENDPOINT variable.
                Previously

                this had been detected as changing every time the script was run

                due to a comparison between 'null' and ''. This resulted in the

                'start-resin-supervisor' script always running through the

                'runSupervisor' path. With this variable check removed, and no
                config

                updates being detected, the script was trying to run

                'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' and failing due to the

                absence of the /var/log/supervisor-log directory. To fix this
                problem we

                unconditionally test for and create this directory (if
                necessary) so

                that it is available regardless of the path taken through the
                script.

                Change the chrony UDP source port from 123 (privileged) to

                1234 (non-privileged).


                Previous issues with Phicomm routers had required the use of a
                fixed

                UDP source port, so port 123 was chosen as this is used by both
                ntpd

                and ntpdate. However recent testing has shown that using a
                privileged

                port such as 123 can cause issues on other networks. By changing
                the

                port to be non-privileged (i.e. 1234) we can satisfy both
                network

                requirements.

              hash: 1c1374f3c8b5914b7e645f8068ebafc8b4cbbe3a
              body: >
                The handling of the RTC at boot time has been improved as
                follows:


                1) A 'timeinit-rtc.sh' script has been added to improve logging
                of
                   system time updates from the RTC and to prevent system time
                   being set when RTC time is behind system time. If RTC time is
                   found to be behind system time a warning is issued regarding
                   potential RTC battery failure.

                2) The 'timeinit-rtc.service' has been added to the new systemd
                   'time-set.target'. This allows for better control and
                   co-ordination between the various time source services.

                3) Systemd dependencies have been updated to ensure that the
                   RTC is the final time service before the 'time-set.target'
                   is reached.

                The 'timeinit-buildtime.sh' script has been updated to use the

                new support functions provided by the 'os-helpers-time' script.

                        A docker-compose.yml with the following structure


                        ```

                        version: '2.1'

                        services:
                          app_1:
                            build: ./noisy-1
                            image: noisy1

                        Will lead to the supervisor creating multiple image
                        database entries

                        with the same dockerId (this is because of how the
                        engine handles this

                        particular case). This case is not handled by the
                        removal process

                        leading to image pile up and increased disk usage.

                        The memory information reported by the supervisor
                        currently

                        estimates the value of used memory as `MemTotal -
                        MemFree`.

                        However, linux systems will try to cache and buffer as
                        much

                        memory as possible, which will affect the output of
                        `MemFree`

                        (from /proc/meminfo) and in consequence the memory usage
                        seen

                        by the user on the dashboard, which will appear much
                        greater than

                        it is.


                        The correct calculation should be `MemTotal - MemFree -
                        Buffers - Cached`,

                        which the calculation performed by `htop` and the `free`
                        commands.

                        set of capabilities, but that can come later

                        When trying to apply SSDT overlays in Up Board, the
                        supervisor currently

                        gets stuck in a loop trying to apply target state. See
                        #1465


                        This was due to a bug in parsing the configuration,
                        which lead to

                        the method bootConfigChangeRequired returning true when
                        no change was

                        needed.

                        Each service, when requesting access to the Supervisor
                        API, will

                        now get an individual key which can be scoped to
                        specific resources.

                        In this iteration the default scope will be to the
                        application that

                        the service belongs to.


                        We also have a `global` scope which is used by the cloud
                        API when in

                        managed mode.

        kernel 4.19.95. Also, we remove
        0001-Revert-cgroup-Add-kernel-param-to-enable-memory-grou.patch since
        it's not needed anymore and we also remove
        0001-Add-poe-overlay-for-compatiibility.patch since that overlay is now
        in present in the kunbus kernel source tree.
        We also removed linux-raspberrypi.inc and we are basing on the
        equivalent file from the BSP.

                By default chrony uses a random UDP source port for each NTP
                request.

                This can cause problems with particular routers/firewalls
                (issues have

                been reported for the Phicomm KE 2P).


                The chrony `acquisitionport` configuration setting has been
                added

                to the chrony.conf file to change the UDP source port for NTP
                requests

                to 123 (this is the same as the default source port used by both

                ntpdate and ntpd).

                Drop the '-s' command line parameter from chronyd as:

                a) restoring time from the drift file is no longer necessary due
                to

                the fake-hwclock service, and

                b) restoring time from the RTC is already covered by the
                timeinit-rtc

                service.

                reboots"

                In order to produce sensible timestamps for journald log
                messages:

                a) the system time needs to be maintained correctly over a
                reboot, and

                b) the system time needs to be set before journald is started.


                Currently the system time is maintained over reboots on systems

                without an RTC using the last modified time of the chrony drift
                file.

                However there are a couple of issues with this approach:


                a) /var/lib/chrony/ is not mounted early enough in the boot
                process

                to be available for setting the time before journald is started.

                b) there is an issue with the current systemd dependencies that
                result

                in the last modified time of the drift file not being updated
                when the

                system is shutdown or rebooted (see #1995).


                The Debian fake-hwclock service (as used by Raspberry Pi OS) has
                been

                added to overcome these issues.


                The fake-hwclock service will save and restore the system time
                from

                the fake-hwclock.data file (in /etc/fake-hwclock/). The system
                time

                is loaded from this file at boot and saved to it on shutdown. An

                additional timer service has been added to update the file on an

                hourly basis to cater for unexpected shutdown scenarios, e.g.
                power

                failure.


                The timeinit-timestamp service has improved logging and has been

                renamed to timeinit-buildtime for clarity.


                A new time-set.target has been added as per upstream systemd and

                the fake-hwclock and timeinit-buildtime services have been added

                to it.

        it makes the upper 256MB of memory unusable. We have tried to compensate
        with zram but that is not a suitable solution from a long-term
        perspective.

    - subject: "u-boot: fix possible freeze in uart driver"
      hash: 90349ca44f6e2db78f2a15aba1d8f62864eae85e
      body: |
        It was reported that in certain configurations
        u-boot can possibly freeze with putc_retry located
        in bss instead of data. This because the serial
        driver is used before relocating. Add this change
        to the Pi4 rebased patch too.

                This only applies to the host configuration files which are the

                that force a reboot.

                If the rootfs is on a slow-to-bring-up device (e.g. RPi4 + USB)

                the fsuuidsinit_enabled() function may return before the balena
                symlinks

                are created. This gets wrongly interpreted as missing UUIDs
                leading to

                a chain of failures in the subsequent scripts.

                This patch moves the symlink waiting loop from fsuuidsinit_run()

                to fsuuids_enabled() before the first usage of the symlink.

                We allow the user to specify a custom CA in the .balenaRootCA
                key

                of config.json but at this moment each tool has to implement
                support

                if it wants to use it. This commit adds it to the system-wide CA
                bundle

                so that the CA is respected everywhere.

                        Due to switching to Alpine the ability to resolve mDNS
                        hostnames was lost. This patch overrides the lookup and
                        manually resolves the names.

        The linux-raspberrypi.inc was copied from master when the kernel
        recipe was added.
        It had the BOOTFILES_DIR_NAME var which is not defined
        elsewhere and which determined cmdline.txt not being installed
        Fix this by using the inc file from meta-raspberrypi and
        delete the copied one

        In production images enable_uart is not set in config.txt
        and we don't want to output anything to the console either.
        Let's not load the pl11 serial driver because it freezes boot when
        enable_uart is not set.

                                        This is a hack, and should be reverted
                                        once we get to the bottom of it.

                                        It will impact performance, but right
                                        now there are things that should

                                        be filtered and are not, so lets get
                                        this merged for security purposes.

                                        Hopefully this library will be
                                        re-written soon.

                Recently the supervisor added a codepath that assumes no files
                underneath it will change during runtime.

                OS update hooks can trigger a condition whereby the supervisor
                reboots the device during a HUP,

                which in turn bricks the device.


                Additionally, since unknown args cause this update to
                fail-closed,

                remove that barrier to future-proof more flag expansion.

    - subject: Use 1GB kernel / 3GB userspace memory split for 32-bit kernels
      hash: 96e567e3c1315f9a595dc16f86cdc2dbeb0bfb9f
      body: |
        At this moment we are using the default 2GB kernel / 2GB userspace
        memory split which causes issues for the application that need to
        map more than 2GB of memory (e.g. balena engine). The other 32-bit
        boards default to 1GB kernel / 3GB userspace ratio which seems to
        be more reasonable in general.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the
                supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit
                creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory,
                these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create
                them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the
                /var/log/supervisor-log

                directory and creates it if required.

                In rocko, systemd kills any script started in background,
                same thing happening to children that get re-parented.

                One solution to this is to use a separate service file for
                starting the healtcheck image load script, after balena.service
                was started.

                Otherwise, as util-linux has a higher default alternative
                priority, the

                version in util-linux is chosen. It would seem they are
                exchangeable, but

                the busybox version reportedly works even if the RTC interrupt
                line is not

                connected.

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create
                them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the
                /resin-data/resin-supervisor

                directory and creates it if required.

                When performing hostOS updates, the resin-logo.png might have

                been customized by the customer.

                This commits renames it to the newly branded balena-logo.png


                If the resin-logo.png was unmodified, it will forcefully replace
                to

                balena-logo.png to force rebranding of older resin branded
                release.

                The `docker` Docker Hub repository lists what versions of the
                image

                are supported and 18.6 is not among them at all. Use the current
                stable

                line of 18.09 instead, to stay on supported versions. See more
                info at:

                https://hub.docker.com/_/docker


                For more reproducability, we are also including the patch level
                version

                of the container, which will give us more responsibility to
                update more

                frequently, but fewer surprises.


                Also explicitly set `DOCKER_HOST` for the daemon being started,
                otherwise

                the base image's setting might silently take over, and modify
                this.


                Replace deprecated `-g` (graph driver) with `--data-root` as
                well.

                resin-init has a hardcoded command to disable power management

                on wlan0. This commit moves the logic to udev rule as there is

                no guarantee wlan0 is the only or default wlan adapter in the
                system.


                There seems to be no better way to identify a wlan device in
                udev

                than KERNEL=="wl*" which should match both net.ifnames=0 (wlanX)

                and net.ifnames=1 (wlpX).

                        Controlled by BALENA_HOST_FIREWALL_MODE, the firewall
                        can

                        either be 'on' or 'off'.

                        In the absence of an upstream implementation of the DeviceRequest API introduced
                        as part of Docker API v1.40 we roll our own using a feature label.

                        As per my comment in the code, we fall back to the default behavior of
                        docker cli's `--gpu` and request single device with the `gpu` capabilty.
                        The only implementation at the moment is the NVIDIA driver; here:
                        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/blob/master/daemon/nvidia_linux.go

                        We were treating the database class as a singleton, but
                        still having to pass

                        around the db instance. Now we can simply require the db
                        module and have

                        access to the database handle.

                This enables a compressed RAM swap of 25% of total system memory
                or 1GB,

                whichever smallest.


                Upstream Yocto has a zram implementation that's broken in
                warrior, and a

                new implementation introduced in Zeus that does not work in
                BalenaOS as

                we run two udevs, one in the initramfs and one in the main OS.
                The

                mkswap needs to happen in the initramfs udev otherwise the udev
                database

                is not updated with the swap device and the zram0 device is not
                detected

                by systemd.


                This implementation is simpler than the one upstream and common
                to all

                the supported Yocto versions. It uses a udev rule in the
                initramfs that

                creates the swap drive, and a swap unit in the main OS that
                enables it.

              hash: 034ff61a58f30a980514157412c0455b52ddf744
              body: >
                When the user supplies an additional NTP server source which is
                a

                pool URL the 'burst' command may fail. This occurs when the pool

                URL resolves to a different IP addresses for the 'add server'
                and

                'burst' commands.


                To avoid this issue we can combine the burst functionality into
                the

                'add server' command by using the 'iburst' option. Although this

                option is not documented by the chronyc man page it has been
                present

                since v1.25 released in 2011.


                This fix has been tested via the balenaOS (2.51.1+rev1) command
                line

                running on a RPi3.

              body: >
                The change this commit reverts allowed to update with a locally

                available image - but it also has the side effect of restarting
                the

                supervisor even if no update is required and that has
                unintentional

                consequences as
                https://github.com/balena-io/balena-supervisor/issues/1358

                The dependency is introduced by the upstream.sh and

                external

                scripts too.

        We previously introduced dependency loading between bt8xxx and mlan but
        yocto did not generate the modprobe.d file as expected so now let's
        correct that by defining the mlan dependency on bluetooth in a separate
        file altogether.

              body: >
                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run
                directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run
                is not there.


                This commit switches to use /tmp to store the new UUID for the
                root partition on

                first boot after generating new UUIDs.

                rust is used for various utilities in the OS.

                e.g. os-config, healthdog, bindmount, some others maybe


                At the moment, we haven't syncronized on one rust version and
                device

                integration layers can pick any meta-rust version. Which
                probably uses

                the latest rust version in the layer.


                Lets sync on 1.36 and move in steps when needed.

                        This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor

                        is required when the host OS is doing stateful
                        firewalling.


                        This should not affect things when stateful firewalling
                        is not in

                        effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT,
                        so we're just

                        being explicit about it.

              body: >
                When a partition filesystem label is detected, udev checks
                whether the

                device belongs to the same disk as the root partitition passed
                in the

                kernel command line by the bootloader. Only if it does, it
                creates a by-state

                link to it.


                By using this by-state links we avoid filesystem label clashes
                as the

                system will always use partitions in the same drive as root (as

                instructed by the bootloader who is the source of truth).

                balenaOS uses FAT as a fs type for the boot/first partition.
                This is

                currently hardcoded so let's have the related kernel configs
                built in

                the kernel image. In this way we don't have to handle kernel
                modules in

                the initramfs (when needed).

        We backport these 3 patches from upstream u-boot
        2020.04 as they seem to fix a sporadic HUP issue
        where bootcount can't be saved from the
        environment to the filesystem:

      hash: 272608beffe0786229ec11f2eade6ae9389e7721
      body: |
        It appears that when the console is incorrectly configured
        in the dtb, booting will get stuck while trying to write
        chars to the uart.

        The 16bit for the counter seems the most appropriate, as
        booting time is insignificantly impacted in the worst case,
        while no chars from logs appear to be lost if the uart is
        configured correctly.

                Lets pass it here to keep it correct.


                Should not have any actual affect. NM plugin was built with
                reference

                to the 2.4.7 headers. Just the directoy path would say 2.4.5

                We also delete the patch that switched the 12d1:1f01 modems to
                NCM mode with that specific MessageContent because that made
                other Huawei modems that used the same vid:pid combination
                unusable in that mode. So now these modems will work in the old
                Hilink mode using cdc_ether instead.

                Some devices have special tools in the initramfs that bloat it.

                e.g. Jetson family have tegra-firmware-xusb etc.


                IMAGE_ROOTFS_MAXSIZE triggers an error if the rootfs goes beyond
                this

                limit. This does not force the rootfs to an empty fixed size.


                We can comfortably increase the max size to 32MB to reduce
                unnecessary

                patches in the device integration layers.


                We'll still be covered by the full resin-rootA size limit.

              body: >
                The DNS clients (applications) resolver libraries use the
                timeout value in

                /etc/resolv.conf to set the time between DNS attempts. The
                default is 5

                secs which for slow networks like cellular mean lots of DNS
                requests on

                a bandwidth sensitive channel.


                This change modifies the default to 15 secs. This timeout only
                applies

                This commit increases the default NTP poll rate to around 4.5
                hours.


                BalenaOS uses chronyd for time synchronization, and it allows to
                specify

                a minpoll and maxpoll values per server with a power of two
                number of

                seconds for the minimum and maximum polling time respectively.


                With those constraints, the change set both limits to 2^14s
                (4.55h) for

                all servers.


                An architectural decision has been made not to make this
                configurable.


                Fixes #1780.

                It is better to use fdisk to check that an internal media
                is a suitable block device rather than using the shell
                internal block testing feature. This is because there is
                at least a case when the kernel lists an ASMT 2115 controller
                as /dev/sda but that is not an actual drive so it cannot be
                written to and the flashing procedure will error out.

              hash: 3004762e71383e6ed8134de526966c6dd660fca2
              body: >
                We inherit do_populate_lic_deploy from poky. It uses IMAGE_NAME

                which includes DATETIME


                DATETIME changes between runs so we can sometimes get into a
                state

                where the do_populate_lic_deploy task has its stamp file set.


                But when our subsequent deploy_image_license_manifest task runs,
                the

                DATETIME is different. Hence we get into a state where we have
                to

                run cleanall on the resin-image-flasher recipe to clean up
                directories.


                Lets mark do_populate_lic_deploy with nostamp. This should make
                it

                run every time we need to run deploy_image_license_manifest with
                the

                most up to date DATETIME variable to prevent any hiccups

                Fixes #1630


                Need to make the script go in the background in ExecStartPost=.

                Otherwise, the service status never gets to active/running
                resulting

                it in remaining stuck in an endless loop.


                If the health-check load fails for whatever reason, the
                subsequent

                engine healthcheck will fail retriggering the healthcheck load.

        By default this comes enabled from
        meta-balena, but none of the raspberrypi
        machines generate a flasher image.

        Disabling this allows for adding usb to
        resin_uboot_device_types without actually
        starting usb, unless it is confirmed that
        there's no balena image on the sd-card.

        Some specific fincm3 patches were applying to

        This lead to kernel startup failure of the pi4-64

        "Starting kernel..." log and the board would
        freeze.

        issues will appear when attempting to draw
        images on it.

        This small display is not meant for console,
        therefore fbcon should not takeover the fb
        created by its' driver.

        This issue does not occurr if another
        framebuffer is already present and used,
        as console is not switched to the new one.

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in
                some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot
                preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps
                etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that
                completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

        This driver is built-in so we disable it's init.
        We need to disable this kernel driver in order to avoid concurrent
        access to the GPU from both the kernel bcm2708_fb driver and u-boot's
        simplefb driver. (See https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/3139)

                PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there
                is no

                way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a
                result,

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is
                reasonable.

      body: >
        balenaFin uAP interface needs to be unmanaged by default as
        NetworkManager does

        not support well AP mode. If not added, NetworkManager may try to
        connect to

        defined networks through `uap0` instead of `wlan0`, which is not
        possible.

      body: >
        In addition to enabling the uap0 interface, two parameters are exposed
        for

        overriding through config.txt.


        `wifi_dbg` could be used for tuning the verbosity of the WiFi driver.


        `wifi_mode` could be used for activating/deactivating WiFi interfaces.
        For

        example `dtparam=wifi_mode=1` will only expose the `wlan0` interface.

        Also remove all the extra boot firmware which is present in the boot
        partition (this extra boot firmware comes from the fact that now the
        RaspberryPi 4 has different boot firmware from the previous versions
        so we need to clean all builds accordingly)

                We have found a rare corner case bug where the journal bloats
                beyond

                its limit and fills the state partition. Triggering a vacuum on
                reboot

                helps a bit in case the device is restarted to recover its
                function.

                Customer reported Huawei E3372 not working
                anymore starting with balenaOS v2.32.
                The fix for this appears to be switching the modem with
                vid and pid 12d1:1f01 from the cdc_ether legacy mode to
                the faster mbim mode and setting mtu=1460 in the modem
                connection file.

                After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or
                user)

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the
                bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the
                bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have
                not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                to get it in the previous layers as well.

              hash: aa0a389ea92a71123813f291833fea61f4965164

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will
                require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to
                support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a
                device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                meta-balena. This patch adds a task to include config_resin.h
                into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be
                enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever
                strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot
                reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset
                command

                which it probably should.

                The data partition contains the supervisor which is only about
                61M on

                the pi3. We compress the data partition later on so don't notice
                these

                zeros. But lets reduce the size of the data partition to eat
                less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

      body: >
        The original version had a reset pin, which does not exist for this
        chipset. The

        related dts property is purged from the source code.


        A `post_power_on` hook is now used instead of `pre_power_on`.
        Specifications

        for all Marvel chips require the PDn pin to be asserted AFTER the chip
        is powered

        on. The original implementation using `pre_power_on` was incorrect.


        The balenaFin device tree overlay is adjusted to be using the patched
        driver.

    - subject: Patches for TCP-based remote denial of service vulnerabilities
      hash: e5d92f9ac7ed96c17680d641f1f7aa034f80eb55
      body: |
        Netflix has identified several TCP networking vulnerabilities
        in FreeBSD and Linux kernels. The vulnerabilities specifically
        relate to the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) and TCP
        Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) capabilities.
        The most serious, dubbed SACK Panic, allows a
        remotely-triggered kernel panic on recent Linux kernels.

        These patches address most of these vulnerabilities.

                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS
                to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For
                example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release.
                After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we
                support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now
                with

                both cases.

      body: |
        The pi-bluetooth gets chained in through
        a dependency in bluetooth, in thud. This dependency
        is defined in bluez5 and matches the machine.
        Currently, the raspberrypi BSP only does it for
        raspberrypi zero wireless and raspberrypi3.
        To adapt this for the balena machine setup (which has
        raspberrypi and raspberrypi zero wireless support in the
        same machine) the same dependency needs to be added.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and will come
                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.

                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped handling
                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device: disable
                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only the
                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface will
                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default route for
                the target IP.

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                this

              body: >
                Since 1.29, busybox switched to an internal implementation of
                the

                resolver based on a feature config, NSLOOKUP_BIG. This is
                enabled by

                default and it's meant to be musl compatible. In BalenaOS we use
                glibc

                and we rely on it for being able to resolve names using NSS
                modules

                (libmdns).

                This adds an easier to debug logging that shows both removed and
                kept

                firmwares. For example:

                 Cleaning iwlwifi firmware version 8000C to minimum API version 34.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-13.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-22.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-21.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-31.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-27.ucode.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-34.ucode in place.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-36.ucode in place.

                Also, this commit improves the version comparison which was
                comparing

                strings and not integers. Now we try integer comparison and
                fallback to

                string when parse fails.


                Finally, the task's vardeps expands varflags to correctly
                retrigger on

                change.

                This adds set_os_cmdline which defines os_cmdline so that BSPs

                Also, as

                part of os_cmdline, there is an argument added when the booted
                image is

                a flasher. This can be used in the OS for various flasher
                specific

                checks.

              hash: 2159c397b0560d03441806573e14bfbcf52a7e7b
              body: >
                Since yocto thud, and more specifically since poky switched to

                openssl 1.1 line, the openssl binary is provided by
                'openssl-bin'. On

                that version, 'openssl' doesn't provide this binary making the
                uuid

                generation script fail.


                This patch makes 'openssl-bin' the default dependency but does
                that in a

                way that older yocto versions can overwrite it back to the old
                provider

                (openssl package).

              body: >
                When we set the udev rule we use IMPORT{program} to know what
                symlinks

                to create in the sysroot directory. The problem is that we don't
                use

                absolute paths and from the documentation udev uses
                /usr/lib/udev as the

                default path while we install the invoked script in /lib/udev.


                ```
                  Execute an external program specified as the assigned value. If no
                  absolute path is given, the program is expected to live in
                  /usr/lib/udev; otherwise, the absolute path must be specified.
                ```


                This PR changes the udev rule to use an absolute path for the

                resin_update_state_probe script. Also it fixes some typos in the
                script

                itself.

            - subject: Make security flags inclusion yocto version specific
              hash: 9571c572e4abcd1ea5951fa408b1543bc40db8c9
              body: |
                Since thud, poky distro file on which balena OS is based, already
                includes security_flags.inc. Because of this change, this version throws
                a build warning similar to:

                WARNING Duplicate inclusion for /build/../layers/poky/meta/conf/distro/include/security_flags.inc
                in /build/../layers/meta-resin/meta-balena-thud/conf/distro/include/balena-os-yocto-version.inc

                This happens because again, we import `poky` and `security_flags` but
                since thud, poky includes security_flags by default. In order to avoid
                this warning we import it (security_flags) now using an .inc file at the
                level of the yocto version meta-balena layer. There is as well a small
                additional wrinkle here. We switch the include statement from `require`
                to `include` so new layers (like thud) don't have to carry this hack in
                the future.

                This commit prepares meta-balena for thud support.

                We used to have this patch applied for all the supported yocto
                versions.

                Since thud, this patch is included by default so this change
                backports

                it on all the rest of the supported mate-balena yocto version
                specific

                layers.

                The reason for including this version is that balena-engine
                requires

                newer go compiler and also we want to unify it across our
                supported

                yocto versions to avoid eventual possible runtime issues.

                balenaOS comes in two flavours, production/development.
                production

                images have various options passed to the kernel cmdline.

                Currently some devices BSPs have those options passed and some
                dont.

                It'll be hard to keep the common options consistent.

                e.g. consoleblank=0 is passed for some devices and not for
                others.


                We'd like the extra options we pass to be in one place. All BSPs
                can

                then append this variable in their respective recipe/bootloader
                config

                etc.

            - subject: Fix bug where fsck was run on the data partition on every boot even if
                it wasn't needed due to old system time.
              hash: aa0d2154eb8aeee220807211317eafe153f46378
              body: >
                e2fsck by default checks differences between the system time and
                the

                last filesystem mount timestamp.


                As we run on devices without an rtc, and we run the
                filesystem-expand

                service which runs fsck before ntp sync happens, this results in
                errors

                like


                Superblock last mount time (Thu Mar 14 17:13:02 2019,
                      now = Mon Mar 11 15:29:56 2019) is in the future.
                Fix? yes


                This results in fsck running on the data partition on every boot
                which

                slows down the boot time.


                Add e2fsck.conf file with the broken_system_clock flag to
                prevent this

                check from running fsck on every boot. Quite a few distros do
                this as

                well.

              hash: 5da7792e8c85f49fed15488ca983c1252f120d8b
              body: >
                Currently mmc and usb devices are checked at every boot for the
                presence

                of flasher images. USB initialization is slow 1-3 seconds. This
                slows

                boot time significantly.


                Most device types dont need to check for the presence of flasher
                images

                in usb devies. Modify u-boot to only check for mmc devices.


                usb initialization happens in devices via the "usb start"
                command. This

                is usually configured in CONFIG_PREBOOT for devices. Devices
                will need

                to remove "usb start" from CONFIG_PREBOOT to benefit from any
                boot time

                optimization.


                We will need to run "usb start" ourselves via env_resin for any
                device

                that happens to be searching for flasher images in usb device
                types.

                It is best to not create anything in ${B} even if just temporary
                because

                it alters the directory in ways which can break other parts of
                the build

                system. For example, if there is a leftover kernel_source.tar.gz
                in B,

                then the current kernel-devsrc will create a hardlink of this
                file in

                the kernel source tree and then the command:

                tar -czf ${B}/kernel_source.tar.gz -C "$kerneldir/../" .


                will fail like:

                tar: ./kernel/kernel_source.tar.gz: file changed as we read it

                hexadecimal

                input format"


                We only hit this in the jetson family as the boot partition
                there is

                0xc. Add a simple conversion to hex. This should not affect any
                devices

                that use <9 partition numbers. And allow us to use the same hook

                from meta-balena accross all devices. Currently the jetson
                family has

                its own custom hook with this one-liner.

                We might start hitting this when the supervisor starts rebooting
                devices

                more gracefully after
                https://github.com/balena-io/balena-supervisor/issues/861

                is resolved.

              hash: 3050840935541c14ded2f9a6a1517d73dfc5ec18
              body: >
                There can be cases where a image type gets invalidated (due to a

                variable change or so) and the dependency of it not. For example
                the img

                type can get invalidated while the hostapp ext3 type doesn't.
                The img

                generatiton script consumes/uses the rootfs generated by the
                hostapp

                type but, it references the artifact based on IMAGE_NAME
                variable which

                includes a time stamp. See bitbake.conf:


                IMAGE_NAME = "${IMAGE_BASENAME}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}"


                When that happens, the new timestamp will change and img will
                fail to

                find the old artifact of hostapp. Change this behaviour by using
                the

                symlink reference IMAGE_LINK_NAME which doesn't include a
                timestamp.

        This commit removes the "enable_uart=1" from config.txt
        in debug builds to prevent u-boot from sending logs on
        UART of RevPi Core3.

        We disable the mmc dtoverlay from config.txt so RevPi Core3 can
        booot.
        If this overlay is enabled u-boot will try to boot OS from a
        different mmc interface.
        Also we disable overlay warnings so the uart interface is silent.
        RevPi Core3 uses this uart interface to communicate with the
        modules on RS485.

              hash: 706829bc46c593048909686a67faef064adf6232
              body: >
                63baa421 introduced a bug where the tools in the header tarballs
                were

                compiled with the incorrect HOSTCC parameter. As a result the
                tools

                inside the tarball were compiled for x86-64 instead of the
                native

                device architecture. And they had the incorrect ld interpreter
                path

                as well.


                Update to v0.0.12 to fix that.

                This release also adds objtool support needed by the intel nuc
                image.


                Fixes #1302

                For now only allow `wifi.scan-rand-mac-address` configurable
                from

                config.json using `randomMacAddressScan` as the json key.


                config.json snippet example:


                "os": {
                  "network" : {
                    "wifi": {
                      "randomMacAddressScan": false
                    }
                  }
                }


                We include a set of tests for this tool which are ran at build
                time.

                entries but some of these files ended up in `files`. This works
                well if

                the recipe used is the one in the same directory as the `files`

                subdirectory will be used by default. The problem shows when the
                recipe

                is not in the same directoy as bitbake will not be able to find
                needed

                bbappended files.

                The label is actually a udev symlink, but we're keeping

                this naming to be consistent across the file.


                The error seen is that the balena-host service wasn't

                able to start because of a mnt-sysroot-active.service
                dependency:

                resin-partition-mounter[440]: ERROR: Timeout while waiting

                for filesystem label to appear


                By increasing this timeout, the filesystem symlink should

                already exist, at the time the mnt-sysroot-active service is

                looking for this dependency.

        We disable autoboot stopping by pressing any key combinations because
        there are cases where other ICs are connected to the pi's UART and it
        is possible that the other ICs are sending the particular autoboot
        stop combination over UART.

                As part of resin rename to balena, we rename the distro file
                including

                the OS name which is part of the distro name. This ends up in
                the

                dashboard as part of the OS version.

        The current integration in uboot uses the ext bootcount driver which
        doesn't use upgrade_available. The entire rollback support design is
        currently based on this variable (upgrade_available) so if that is not
        taken into consideration the board will increment bootcount with every
        boot breaking the board after the first boot. Disable for now this
        feature.

                `authorize_keys` file will be merged at every ssh connection in
                the dropbear

                service.


                These SSH custom public keys in config.json are assumed to be
                provided

                as an array in `.os.sshKeys`. Example:

                {

                This patch replaces the "Client identifier" option from
                DHCP packets sent by NM to resemble the way udhcpc does it.

                The reason is that the Cisco RV325 router with fw older than
                v1.2.1.14 doesn't reply to DHCP requests or discovery packages
                if the "Client identifier" option is formatted in NM's style.

                Even though this is a bug in the router's fw, we are going to
                fix it here because we encountered clients that couldn't get
                an IP address on these routers and we want to avoid that

                allows mobynit to mount a rootfs from a custom path.


                The command ./mobynit -sysroot /mnt/sysroot/inactive will mount
                the

              body: >
                Before multicontainer support in resin, the user container was
                running

                over the host's network stack which means that all the packets
                were

                treated as locally emitted ones. In this case, the communication
                was

                redirected as per the OUTPUT iptable rule only.

                In the "multicontainer world" the user containers run on top of
                bridge

                network which makes the host act as a socksifying router. In
                this case,

                the packets won't go through the OUTPUT chain and the
                redirection to

                redsocks needs to happen at PREROUTING chain.

                This change adds a redirect rule at PREROUTING for TCP packets
                to

                redsocks to redirect packets from the containers to redsocks
                too.


                As well, this adds support for redirecting DNS UDP packets to
                redsocks.

                This is implemented as iptables rules which are only added if
                the

                redsocks configuration has a `dnsu2t` section.

                i.e. resinOS_uEnv.txt says we should boot resin_root_part=3. But
                we are

                actually running resinOS from resin_root_part=2. This can happen
                if

                a reboot happened without clearing upgrade_available in
                resinOS_uEnv

                txt file. A kernel panic happened etc.


                The rollback-altboot script runs hostapp-update hooks to change
                the

                bootfiles.


                The rollback-health.service runs rollback-health which checks if
                vpn is

                online and balena is healthy after a hostapp-update.

                This patch adds a simple check in env_resin.h.


                If bootcount is found to be greater than bootlimit, switch the

                partitions. Both bootcount and bootlimit are standard u-boot env

                variables.


                To enable rollback in devices, devices have to do the following
                in

                their u-boot


                Enable CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR, CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT and depending
                on the

                device, save the bootcount in some persistant location whether
                that

                is an area in the SoC or an ext partition etc.


                If you are using the CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT driver, use only the
                boot

                partition and use the filename "bootcount.env"


                E.g. for rpi3

                CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR=y

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR=0x02300000

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_DEVPART=0:1

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_NAME="bootcount.env"

                Devices that support automated os rollbacks will have two extra

                variables upgrade_available and resin_root_part in their
                grub.cfg

                files.


                Check for the presense of those variables and update them if
                they

                exist.


                Otherwise stick to the previous way of updating grub.cfg


                For devices using grub 2.0, devices will have to mirror the
                pattern

                that exists in u-boot.

                i.e.
                 Add a variable upgrade_available to grub.cfg (HUP hooks update this)
                 Add a variable bootcount to grubenv that increments if
                 upgrade_available is set
                 Add logic in grub.cfg to boot the alternate rootB/A if bootcount
                 reaches 2.

                u-boot uses an upgrade_avaiable flag to update bootcount to
                reduce

                writes to sd card.


                If upgrade_available=0, u-boot won't bother updating the
                bootcount

                variable. During HUP, we'll set upgrade_available=1 so that
                u-boot

                starts counting.


                It'll be the job of the new OS and the rollback services to set

                upgrade_available=0


                For some devices, u-boot will save the bootcount in the boot
                partition

                in /mnt/boot/bootcount.env. Remove that counter when running

                With Sumo 19.0.1, when building cargo 0.25.0 we get:

                | error[E0425]: cannot find function `read_to_string` in module
                `fs`

                |   -->
                /yocto/resin-board/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/cargo-native/

                0.25.0-r0/cargo_home/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/

                libssh2-sys-0.2.11/build.rs:99:26

                let config =
                fs::read_to_string("libssh2/src/libssh2_config_cmake.h.in")

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?


                This is just one example of a package that fails like this.
                There are

                multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this
                error.


                The cargo bbclass does a:

                cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release


                This has the following effect:

                NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.

                Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`


                Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned
                upstream.

                In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that
                require a

                newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0).
                But at the

                same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust
                version.

                (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)


                The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which
                pins

                the packages to versions which are known to work with rust
                1.24.1,

                the version we use in sumo.

        We do not have at this point an usecase for delaying the autoboot. In
        addition, we have witnessed a case when an IC connected to uart was
        delaying the autoboot by sending lots of data and thus putting the
        entire autoboot to a halt.

        We also change the stop string to be the ASCII code for Vertical Tab
        and enable the alternate option to stop autoboot by pressing CTRL^C.
        In such a case, the actual viable option to stop autoboot remains
        CTRL^C but u-boot also needs CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR defined for
        CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_KEYED_CTRLC to function correctly so that is why we
        set the stop string to VT.

        left in the boot partition.

        This hooks tests for its presence and removes the redundant file.

      hash: c067c2c0148e0943eef8791876b0aa28b235f3c8
      body: |
        To enable Automated Rollback support, we have to make u-boot read
        upgrade_available from resinOS_uEnv.txt and we have to make u-boot
        store the bootcount variable in a file called bootcount.env in the
        boot partition.
        The patches do the following
        - Enable the bootcount config options.
        - Add support to the ext bootcount driver to write bootcount
        in the fat partition.
        - u-boot runs altbootcmd if bootlimit is exceeded.
        We handle this manually in env_resin.h where the resin_root_part is
        switched. Hence use the same bootcmd for altbootcmd.

                With Sumo 19.0.1, when building cargo 0.25.0 we get:

                | error[E0425]: cannot find function `read_to_string` in module
                `fs`

                |   -->
                /yocto/resin-board/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/cargo-native/

                0.25.0-r0/cargo_home/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/

                libssh2-sys-0.2.11/build.rs:99:26

                let config =
                fs::read_to_string("libssh2/src/libssh2_config_cmake.h.in")

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?


                This is just one example of a package that fails like this.
                There are

                multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this
                error.


                The cargo bbclass does a:

                cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release


                This has the following effect:

                NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.

                Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`


                Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned
                upstream.

                In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that
                require a

                newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0).
                But at the

                same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust
                version.

                (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)


                The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which
                pins

                the packages to versions which are known to work with rust
                1.24.1,

                the version we use in sumo.

      body: |
        Currently, CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_DELAY_STR is set to the space character.
        However, in cases where there is another piece of hardware connected
        to the Pi's UART, it is likely that this connected hardware sends the
        space char, thus putting the autoboot process to a halt. So we change
        this to be the 'pause' string instead to reduce likeliness of an
        accidental delay happening.
